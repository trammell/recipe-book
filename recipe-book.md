# Appetizers/Starters

## Smoky Chipotle Hummus with Garlic Bagel Chips

Bon Appétit, October 2001.  Makes 20 servings.

If you don't have time to make your own hummus, buy some at the market or
specialty foods store, and mix in chipotle chilies and cumin to taste.

> 2 15-ounce cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained  
> ½ cup water  
> ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)  
> 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  
> 2 tablespoons olive oil  
> 2½ teaspoons minced canned chipotle chilies  
> 1 large garlic clove, minced  
> 1½ teaspoons ground cumin  
> 1 4-ounce jar sliced pimientos in oil, drained  
> ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro  
> 2 6-ounce packages roasted-garlic bagel chips  

Reserve 3 tablespoons garbanzo beans for garnish. Blend remaining garbanzo
beans and next 7 ingredients in processor until smooth. Add pimientos;
process, using on/off turns, until pimientos are coarsely chopped. Transfer
hummus to medium bowl. Stir in cilantro. Season hummus to taste with salt and
pepper. Sprinkle with reserved garbanzo beans. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover
and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.) Accompany with bagel
chips.

* Tahini ("sesame butter") is sold at Middle Eastern markets, natural foods
  stores and some supermarkets.
* Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo,
  are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some
  supermarkets.

## Roasted Garlic

Bon Appétit, October 1999. Makes about 1 ⅓ cups.

> large heads of garlic  
> ¼ cup olive oil  

Preheat oven to 350 °F. Cut top ¼ inch off heads of garlic to expose cloves.
Place garlic in small baking dish. Add oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper;
toss to coat. Turn garlic cut side up. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake
until garlic skins are golden brown and cloves are tender, about 55 minutes.
Cool. Squeeze garlic cloves from skins.

* Also great mixed into mashed potatoes.

## Susan's Guacamole

Serves 6 (unless Uncle John is visiting then serves not so many)

> 2 medium avocados  
> 1 small tomato, chopped  
> 2 tablespoons minced onion  
> 1-2 teaspoons lime or lemon juice  
> ½ teaspoon garlic powder  
> ½ teaspoon salt  

Peel avocadoes. Mash with a fork in a medium bowl.  Stir in tomato, onion,
lime or lemon juice, garlic powder and salt.  Serve quickly with chips or jicama slices.

* Susan likes using the lemon juice versus the lime.
* The avocado will rapidly darken when exposed to air; to delay this press
  plastic wrap down on to the guacamole to keep air away.

## Crostini with Roasted Garlic, Goat Cheese and Apple Chutney

Bon Appétit, October 1999.  From the 128 Cafe, St. Paul, Minnesota.  Makes 8
Servings

Kari and Brian Chase of St. Paul, Minnesota say that their neighborhood has a
great restaurant: 128 Cafe. The last time they were there they tried a
delicious appetizer of crisp bread with roasted garlic, goat cheese and apple
chutney.

> 1 cup (packed) golden brown sugar  
> ¾ cup rice vinegar  
> 2 garlic cloves, minced  
> 1½ teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger  
> ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper  
> 1 cinnamon stick  
> 1½ pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, cut into ½-inch pieces (about 4 cups)  
> 1 cup golden raisins  
> 1 cup diced seeded plum tomatoes  
> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint  

> 1 French-bread baguette, cut into ⅓-inch-thick slices  
> Olive oil  
> Roasted Garlic  
> 12 ounces soft fresh goat cheese (such as Montrachet), room temperature  

Stir sugar and vinegar in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until sugar
dissolves. Add next 4 ingredients and simmer until mixture is syrupy and
reduced to ½ cup, about 8 minutes. Mix in apples and raisins. Increase heat to
high and boil until apples are tender, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.
Cool to room temperature. (Chutney can be made 3 days ahead; cover and
refrigerate.) Mix in tomatoes and mint.

Preheat oven to 450 °F. Arrange baguette slices on baking sheet and brush with
olive oil. Bake until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes. Spread each toast with
roasted garlic; top with goat cheese and chutney.

* At the restaurant, the bread is grilled, but it's just as good when it's baked.
* A good jarred apple chutney or pear chutney works just as well 



# Soups

## Spicy miso-tahini ramen

From Epicurious. Serves 4. Prep time: 30 minutes.

<https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/spicy-miso-tahini-ramen>

Ingredients:

> 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil  
> 2 tablespoons mirin  
> 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced      
> 8 cups purified water     
> 2 cups thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms   
> 2 tablespoons Japanese chili paste or Sriracha sauce   
> ½ cup organic red miso paste   
> 2 (10-ounce) packages fresh ramen noodles (look for Sun Noodle brand)   
> ¼ cup tahini paste or neri goma   

Toppings:

> 2 cups baby spinach   
> Chili oil, for drizzling (optional)   
> 2 green onions, thinly sliced on the bias   
> Togarashi, for sprinkling (optional)   
> 2 soft-boiled eggs, sliced in half (optional)   
> Nori, cut into small rectangular pieces, for dipping (optional)   
> 1 avocado, pitted, peeled, and thinly sliced   

In a large saucepan or stockpot, warm the toasted sesame oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fragrant and translucent. Add 1 cup of the mushrooms and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes more.

Add the miso paste and tahini and stir to coat the onion and mush­rooms. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Watch your heat carefully and reduce to medium-low, if needed, or the soup can break or separate. Pour in the mirin and deglaze the pan. Pour in the water and stir well to dissolve all the miso paste.

Bring the soup up to a light simmer over high heat and whisk in the chili paste or Sriracha sauce; start with 2 tablespoons to be safe, then add more as desired, and mix well to dissolve. Reduce the heat to medium-high.

In a separate medium saucepan, bring some water to a boil. Add the ra­men noodles, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, remove the noodles from the boiling water or drain the noodles in a colander.
Divide the noodles among four bowls. Add the spinach and green onions to each bowl. Top each bowl equally with the reserved 1 cup mushrooms, the egg, avocado, chili oil, togarashi, and nori as desired, ladle broth over, and serve.

Sliced or diced fresh avocado makes a colorful garnish for this hearty

them with cold water. They will stay bright green for about two hours.

## Hot and Sour Soup

Adapted from Williams-Sonoma Collection Series, _Soup_, by Diane Rossen
Worthington (Simon & Schuster, 2001). 

To rehydrate dried whole mushrooms, place them in a bowl, add boiling water to
cover and let soak for 30 minutes, until soft. For dried mushroom slices,
reduce the soaking time to 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well. For extra mushroom
flavor, reserve the soaking liquid and add it to the dish. Before using, strain
the liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter to remove
any grit.

Accompany the soup with a shredded cabbage salad dressed with rice wine
vinegar, sugar and a little oil.

> 1 oz. dried Chinese black mushrooms or dried shiitake mushrooms  
> 3 cups boiling water  
> 2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. white wine vinegar  
> 1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. soy sauce  
> ½ tsp. Asian sesame oil  
> 1 ¼ tsp. Asian chili oil  
> ½ tsp. freshly ground pepper, plus more, to taste  
> 5 cups chicken stock  
> ½ cup canned thinly sliced bamboo shoots, rinsed and drained  
> 1 boneless, skinless whole chicken breast, about ½ lb., cut crosswise into thin bite-size slices  
> ¼ lb. firm tofu, drained and cut into ½- inch cubes  
> 2 Tbs. cornstarch  
> ¼ cup water  
> 1 egg, well beaten  

Soak the dried mushrooms in the boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain the
mushrooms and slice them thinly. Set aside.

In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil
and the ½ tsp. pepper. Set aside.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Add the
mushrooms and bamboo shoots and cook until the stock is aromatic, about 3
minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken and tofu. Cook until the
chicken is just opaque throughout and the tofu is heated through, about 2
minutes. Add the reserved vinegar-soy mixture and bring to a simmer.

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water and stir until the cornstarch
is dissolved. Add to the soup and stir until the soup begins to thicken. Remove
from the heat. Add the egg, whisking with a fork until little shreds of cooked
egg form. Taste and adjust the seasonings with vinegar, pepper or soy sauce.

Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and serve immediately.



## Adeline's "Round Meat Soup" _aka._ Sausage and Bean Soup

Bon Appétit, November 2000.  Makes 2 servings.  This recipe is very forgiving
if you have too much, too little, or the wrong kind of any ingredients.

> 1 tablespoon olive oil  
> 6 ounces kielbasa or linguiça sausage, cut into thin rounds  
> 1 medium onion, chopped  
> 2¾ cups canned low-salt chicken broth  
> ½ large bunch kale, stems cut away, leaves thinly sliced  
> 1 15-ounce can small white beans, drained  
> ¾ cup dry white wine  

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add sausage and onion; Sauté
until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add broth and kale; bring to boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered 10 minutes. Add beans and wine.
Cook until kale is tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Variations include:

* use beet or carrot greens

## Louisiana Red Beans and Rice

(Tyler Florence recipe from the foodnetwork.com)  
Serves: 6 servings

> 1 pound dried small red beans, picked over and rinsed  
> 2 large smoked ham shanks  
> 1 large yellow onion, chopped  
> 2 celery stalks, chopped  
> 1 large green bell pepper, chopped  
> 1 teaspoon cayenne  
> ¼ bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped  
> 2 sprigs fresh thyme  
> 3 bay leaves  
> 4 garlic cloves, chopped  
> 2 green onions, green part only, chopped, plus more for garnish  
> red pepper sauce  
> 2 andouille sausages, sliced thin  
> 4 cups cooked white rice  

Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak the beans
overnight in the refrigerator.

Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot with the ham hocks, adding
just enough cold water to cover (about 2 quarts). Add the onion, celery,
cayenne, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, green onions, and several shakes
of red pepper sauce; give everything a good stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered,
until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 2½ hours.  You want
the beans to be almost overcooked, like they are getting ready to burst. Stir
the beans occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot. Add about
1 cup of water toward the end of cooking if the mixture appears too thick or
dry.

Mash about 1 cup of the cooked beans against the side of the pot with a wooden
spoon, this makes the broth thick and creamy. Toss in the sausages and green
pepper and cook for another 30 minutes. Adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve
the red beans in a wide bowl over some steamed white rice and garnished with
chopped green onion. 




## Creamy Tomato Soup

Parade, August 2000. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

> 2 tablespoons butter  
> 2 tablespoons olive oil  
> 1 large onion, chopped

> 2 tablespoons tomato paste  
> 1 teaspoon sugar  
> 3 cups chicken broth  
> ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves  
> Salt and pepper, to taste  
> ½ cup half-and-half  

Melt the butter with the oil over low heat in a pot. Add the onion; wilt over
low heat for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic during the last 2 minutes,
stirring. Sprinkle with flour and cook 3 minutes longer, stirring.

Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
to a simmer and cover; cook over medium-low heat for 30 minutes.  Season with
cloves, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Purée the soup in a food processor. Pour through a strainer into a pot. Stir in
the half-and-half.  Warm the soup before serving.



## White Turkey Chili

Made with chunks of cooked turkey, this hearty chili is a wonderful way to use
up leftovers from the Thanksgiving feast.  Serves 6 to 8.

> 2 Tbs. olive oil  
> 1 large yellow onion, diced  
> salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
> 2 tsp. toasted ground cumin  
> 5 garlic cloves, minced  
> 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced

> 1 lb. diced cooked turkey  
> 3 cans (each 15 oz.) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed, or 4½ cups cooked white beans, drained  
> 2 Tbs. minced fresh oregano  
> ⅓ cup minced fresh cilantro  
> ¼ cup cornmeal  
> Shredded jack cheese, sour cream and lime wedges for serving  

In a large sauté pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion,
season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5
to 7 minutes. Add the cumin, garlic and jalapeño and cook, stirring, for 30
seconds. Stir in the chilies and 3½ cups of the broth, and then transfer to a
slow cooker. Stir in the turkey, beans, oregano and cilantro.

Put the cornmeal in a small bowl and slowly whisk in ½ cup of the broth. Stir
the cornmeal mixture into the turkey mixture. Cover and cook on high for 3
hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thin the chili with more
broth if needed.

Ladle the chili into warmed bowls. Serve with cheese, sour cream and lime wedges.

## Warm millet salad with  sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts

From [Delicious Living, March 2013](https://www.deliciousliving.com/recipe/warm-millet-salad-sun-dried-tomatoes-and-pine-nuts/). Author: Trina Kaufman.

The key to fluffy millet is to toast it well before adding a liquid.
Rinsing after toasting helps to remove bitter compounds from the grains' exterior.

Ingredients:

* 1 cup dry, uncooked millet. 
* 2 1/4 cups water
* 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste. 
* 4 tablespoons EVOO (extra-virgin olive oil), divided
* 1/2 cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2/3 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
* 1/3 cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
* 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley

1. Place the dry millet in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Dry-toast the millet, stirring constantly, 10-15 minutes, or until darker and aromatic. Transfer to a fine wire-mesh strainer and rinse under cool running water until runoff is clear. Return to saucepan and carefully add water, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 25-30 
minutes, or until all water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let rest 5-10 minutes.
2. Dry-toast pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat until golden, stirring constantly, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
3. Fluff cooked millet and add to pine nuts. Add dressing, tomatoes, olives, and parsley; toss until combined. Season with salt and pepper.

## Roasted Carrots and Parsnips with White Balsamic

Bon Appétit, November 2010, by Diane Morgan. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  Total
time: 1 hour 30 minutes.

The technique: Roasting is as basic as baking something uncovered, but this
simple process does something magical to vegetables.

The payoff: Roasting caramelizes the sugars and creates veggies that are
browned on the outside and tender on the inside.

> 2¼ pounds medium parsnips, trimmed, peeled, cut into 3x½-inch sticks  
> 1½ pounds medium carrots, trimmed, peeled, cut into 3x½-inch sticks  
> ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil  
> 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar  
> 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary  
> 2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt  
> 1 teaspoon black pepper  

Preheat oven to 425 °F. Combine parsnips and carrots on large rimmed baking
sheet. Add oil and remaining ingredients; toss to coat. Spread in even layer on
baking sheet.

Roast until vegetables are tender and brown around edges, stirring
occasionally, about 50 minutes to 1 hour.

Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature
1 hour, then rewarm in 400 °F oven 15 minutes.

> "Both kale and Brussels sprouts stand up to the test of time and hold
> dressing well for much longer than the standard salad can, making this
> make-ahead salad, the smartest item on your holiday menu."

Makes 8 servings. Prep time: about 30 minutes.

> 1 cup hazelnuts  
> ¼ cup white balsamic or white wine vinegar  
> 2 tablespoons honey  
> 1¼ teaspoon kosher salt  
> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  
> ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Roast hazelnuts for 8-12 minutes in a 350°F oven. Nuts should be in a single
layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Remove when golden brown and fragrant, let
cool, then rub hazelnuts between your fingers to loosen skins. Discard skins.
Roughly chop hazelnuts.

Whisk vinegar, honey, salt, mustard, and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk
in oil. Toss kale and Brussels sprouts with ¼ cup dressing in a large bowl.
Using your hands, massage dressing into kale mixture until leaves are slightly
softened and shiny, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add pomegranate
seeds and remaining dressing and toss to combine. Serve immediately or
refrigerate overnight.

Just before serving, add croutons and hazelnuts and toss to combine.


## Sopa Paraguaya

This recipe is from the King Arthur Flour website:
https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sopa-paraguaya-recipe

Prep time: 20 minutes  
Bake time: 35-40 minutes  
Total time: about 1 hour  
Serves: 8-10 servings  

> 1 Tbsp butter  
> 1 Tbsp vegetable oil  
> 1 cup diced onion   
> ¼ cup diced red bell pepper  
> ¼ cup diced red green pepper   
> 1½ cups cornmeal   
> 1 cup milk   
> 2 Tbsp sugar   
> ½ cup cottage cheese   
> 2 large eggs   
> 1 tsp salt   
> ½ tsp ground black pepper  
> 2 tsp baking powder   
> 1½ cups fresh or frozen corn kernels   
> 1 cup grated Monterey jack cheese  

*Instructions*

1. Preheat the oven to 375 °F. Grease a 9" x 9" pan that's at least 2" deep; a
   shallow 2-quart casserole dish; or a 10" cast-iron skillet (at least 2" deep).
2. In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and pour in the oil.
   Add the onions and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally. If you're
   going to bake in a 10" cast-iron skillet, go ahead and use it to sauté the
   vegetables.
3. Add the peppers and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from the heat and cool to
   room temperature. If you're using the same skillet to bake the bread, remove
   the vegetables. There's no need to wash the pan; just wipe out any stray bits
   of stuck-on veggie.
4. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal and milk.
5. Stir in the sugar, cottage cheese, eggs, salt, pepper, and baking powder.
6. Stir in the corn kernels and cooled onion mixture.
7. Stir in the cheese, and then transfer the batter to the prepared pan. If
   you're using the same skillet in which you sautéed the vegetables, grease it
   again, using non-stick vegetable oil pan spray or shortening.
8. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes (in a 9" x 9" pan), or 30 to 35 minutes (in a 10"
   cast-iron skillet), until the center feels set when lightly touched with your
   finger, and the edges are beginning to brown.
9. Remove from the oven, cut in squares or wedges, and serve warm.

Possible substitutions include ricotta for cottage cheese and pepper jack
cheese for monterey jack.

> 1½ c. whole wheat white flour  
> 1½ Tbs. sugar  
> 1 tsp. salt  
> 1½ tsp. baking soda  
> 2 eggs  
> 2 c. plain low-fat yogurt (I use Greek non-fat)  
> ¼ c. canola oil, plus a little for the skillet  
> 3 Tbs. cold water  

Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda into a
mixing bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients and
add to the fry mixture, stirring lightly to blend.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Pour ¼ c.
of the batter onto the hot surface to form a pancake.  When bubbles come to the
surface of the pancake and the underside is lightly browned, flip the cake and
cook until the other side is lightly browned.

Top with honey-flavored greek yogurt, berries, or maple syrup.

# Meat Main Dishes

## Fragrant Beef Curry with Rice

Bon Appétit, November 2000, from Bill Goodhue of Chino, California. Makes 6
servings.

> "An Indian friend of my mother's gave her this recipe for beef curry back in
> 1936," writes Bill Goodhue of Chino, California. "The recipe has been passed
> on to me, so I can still enjoy the sweet-spicy flavors of this stew more than
> 60 years later."

> 2 pounds well-trimmed boneless beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces  
> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
> 2 large onions, sliced  
> 6 whole cloves  
> 2 large garlic cloves, chopped  
> 2 cinnamon sticks  
> 1 bay leaf  
> ¼ teaspoon dried crushed red pepper  
> 1½ cups whole milk (can substitute coconut milk)  
> 3 large tomatoes, quartered (can substitute crushed canned tomatoes)  
> 1 14-oz can chick peas or equivalent  
> 3 tablespoons Major Grey chutney  
> 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  
> 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger  
> 1½ tablespoons curry powder  
> ½ teaspoon salt  

> hot cooked rice  

Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot
over high heat. Working in batches, add beef to pot and brown on all sides,
about 7 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer to plate.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add onions;
sauté until tender and brown, about 7 minutes. Return beef to pot. Add cloves,
garlic, cinnamon sticks, bay leaf and dried red pepper to pot; stir 1 minute.
Stir in milk, tomatoes, chutney, lemon juice, ginger, curry powder and ½
teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until beef is
tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Uncover; increase heat to medium.   Add chickpeas.  Boil stew until juices are
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.  Serve over rice with naan and samosas.

* This recipe doubles or even triples well.  It also reheats well. Try freezing
  in 1-qt containers, then thawing and warming on the stove (takes about 20
  minutes) for a quick but good mid-week meal.

Alternative crock-pot cooking method:

* Prepare onions and beef as above (this can be done the night before).
* Cook all ingredients except milk and chickpeas in crock pot on low for
  approximately 8 hours.
* Stir in milk and cooked chickpeas, warm and serve.

## Slow-Cooked Carnitas Tacos

Bon Appétit, April 2008, by Amy Finely.  Makes 4 servings.

You'll need a slow cooker for this recipe (a necessity for any busy cook).

> 2 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs or pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 1 ½-inch pieces  
> 2 teaspoons salt  
> 2 teaspoons ground black pepper  
> 2 teaspoons dried oregano (preferably Mexican)  
> ½ large onion, cut into 4 pieces  
> 1 avocado, halved, pitted, sliced  
> Fresh cilantro sprigs  
> Sliced red bell peppers (optional)  
> Corn tortillas  
> Roasted Tomatillo Salsa  

Toss pork in bowl of slow cooker with salt, black pepper, and dried oregano to
coat. Place onion pieces atop pork. Cover slow cooker and cook pork on low
setting until meat is very tender and falling apart, about 6 hours.

Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to cutting board. Discard onion pieces.
Using fingers, shred pork; transfer carnitas to platter. Place avocado slices,
cilantro sprigs, and sliced red bell peppers, if desired, alongside. Wrap corn
tortillas in damp kitchen towel; microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Serve
carnitas with warm tortillas and tomatillo salsa.   




## Barbecued Pork Burgers with Slaw

Gourmet, August 2007, by Alexis Touchet.  Makes 4 -5 burgers.

Spicing up store-bought barbecue sauce with a touch of cayenne and a splash of
vinegar is an easy trick that makes a big difference. Here, pork burgers get a
triple hit of flavor: The sauce gets mixed into the meat, slathered onto the
cooked burgers for the last minute of grilling, and brushed on the bun. A
cabbage slaw with a creamy dressing tops them off with just the right crunch.

> 1 (½-pound) piece green cabbage, cored  
> ¼ cup mayonnaise  
> 1 tablespoon milk  
> 1 tablespoon plus 1½ teaspoons white-wine vinegar, divided  
> ½ cup very finely shredded carrot (1 medium)  
> 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh chives  
> ½ cup bottled tomato-based barbecue sauce  
> ¼ teaspoon cayenne  
> 1½ pounds ground pork  
> 4 Kaiser or soft rolls, split and grilled  

Equipment: an adjustable-blade slicer

Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium heat for gas).

Thinly slice enough cabbage with slicer to measure 2 cups. Whisk together
mayonnaise, milk, and 1 ½ teaspoons vinegar until smooth, then toss with
cabbage, carrots, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Let coleslaw stand at
room temperature, uncovered, while making burgers.

Stir together barbecue sauce, cayenne, ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining
tablespoon vinegar until combined well.

Mix together pork, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and 2 tablespoons
barbecue sauce mixture until combined (do not overmix), then form into 4
(¾-inch-thick) burgers (4 inches in diameter).

Oil grill rack, then grill patties, covered only if using a gas grill, turning
over occasionally, until just cooked through, about 6 minutes total. Brush top
of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce mixture, then turn over and
grill 30 seconds. Brush top of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce,
then turn over and grill 30 seconds more.

Brush cut sides of rolls with remaining ¼ cup barbecue sauce, then sandwich
patties and coleslaw between rolls.

Coleslaw can be made 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Patties can be formed
1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.





## Pork Tenderloin with Herbed Breadcrumb Crust

Bon Appétit, September 1998.  Serves 8.

> 1¾ teaspoons crumbled bay leaves  

> 3 pounds pork tenderloins, trimmed  
> 2 large eggs, beaten to blend  

> 4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter  
> 2 tablespoons olive oil  

Preheat oven to 375 °F. Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Season
to taste with salt and pepper.

Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Dip into eggs, then into breadcrumb
mixture, coating completely.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add half of pork; cook until golden on all sides, about 5
minutes. Place on rack set in large roasting pan. Wipe out skillet. Repeat with
remaining 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon oil and pork.

Roast pork until crust is golden and thermometer inserted into center registers
155 °F, about 20 minutes. Transfer pork to cutting board. Let stand 5 minutes.
Slice pork and serve.



## Baked Chicken Meatballs with Peperonata

> 1½ tablespoons drained capers  
> 1 teaspoon red-wine vinegar  
> ⅛ teaspoon hot red pepper flakes  

Preheat oven to 400 °F with racks in upper and lower thirds.  Toss bell peppers

Soak bread in milk in a small bowl until softened, about 4 minutes.  Cook
pancetta, onion, and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil with ½ teaspoon each of salt
and pepper in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat until onion is softened, about
6 minutes. Cool slightly.

Squeeze bread to remove excess milk, then discard milk. Lightly beat egg in a
large bowl, then combine with chicken, pancetta mixture, bread, and parsley.
Form 12 meatballs and arrange in another 4-sided sheet pan.  Stir together
tomato paste and remaining tablespoon oil and brush over meatballs, then bake

# Poultry Main Dishes

## Orange-Rosemary Chicken

Williams-Sonoma Kitchen, Bon Appétit, July 1997. Serves 6. Total prep time: 45
minutes.


> 1 12-ounce container frozen orange juice from concentrate, thawed  
> ⅓ cup dry white wine  
> ⅓ cup honey-Dijon mustard  
> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried  
> 4 teaspoons soy sauce  
> 2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)  
> 1 large garlic clove, chopped  

> 1 cup hickory smoke chips, soaked in water 30 minutes, drained  
> small (8" x 6") foil container (make out of tinfoil in a pinch)
> 2 7-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces (breasts halved if large)  

Blend first 7 ingredients in processor to make the orange glaze. Set glaze
aside.

Preheat grill to medium. Place smoke chips in foil container with open top.
Set chips atop coals about 5 minutes before grilling. Sprinkle chicken with
salt and pepper. Grill chicken until golden, turning occasionally, about 5
minutes per side. Continue grilling chicken until cooked through, brushing
glaze over chicken and turning occasionally, about 25 minutes longer.
Transfer to platter.

* It's almost as quick to make the citrus-herb glaze that coats the chicken as
  it is to open a bottle of barbecue sauce--and the glaze has a far more
  interesting taste!
* Pour a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc for the grown-ups; the kids should have
  lemonade. Finish up with watermelon and brownies.

Mole, a classic Mexican chili sauce, gets streamlined here. Chipotle chilies
(available canned at Latin American markets and many supermarkets) add heat,
while unsweetened chocolate provides subtle sweetness. Serve the stew in

> ¼ tsp. salt  
> 20 oz chicken, ground  

Mix all ingredients together.  Grill on a griddle sprayed lightly with oil.

* Goes well with coleslaw (see next recipe).
* These do not grill well on an outdoor grill, as they are quite moist.
* Other varieties (e.g. chipotle) of pepper work also.  Use more pepper for a spicier burger!


## Coleslaw for Chicken Burgers

> ½ c. plain yogurt  
> ¼ c. mayonnaise  
> 5 T. apple cider vinegar

in food processor until it forms a rough paste.  Rub salmon with paste.  Divide
spinach and chickpeas evenly among the 4 parchment pieces, season with salt and
pepper.  Lay 1 fillet on top of each.  Fold parchment over ingredients; make
overlapping pleats to seal.

Bake on baking sheet for 9-10 minutes (medium rare) or 11-12 minutes for
medium.

green onions. Cook 1 minute to blend flavors. Remove from heat. Season with
coarse salt and pepper.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and
stir 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in cream. Cook until sauce thickens, whisking
occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add 2 cups Comté cheese; whisk until melted and
sauce is smooth. Whisk in ½ cup Parmesan, then sour cream and mustard.
Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.

Return reserved pot of water to boil. Add pasta and cook until tender but still
firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain; return pasta to same pot. Stir in
cauliflower mixture and sauce.

Butter 13×9×2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon in half of pasta mixture; sprinkle
with ½ cup Comté cheese. Top with remaining pasta mixture and ½ cup Comté
cheese. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in small skillet. Add breadcrumbs
and toss to coat. Remove from heat; mix in ¼ cup Parmesan. Sprinkle crumbs
over pasta. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead.

Let stand at room temperature.  Preheat oven to 350 °F. Bake pasta uncovered
until heated through and bubbling, about 35 minutes.  Broil 1-2 minutes if
topping needs help browning.

* Instead of making in one large dish, consider instead baking your pasta in
  an equivalent number of ramekins. This way you can customize your dish if
  you have any picky eaters!
* This dish freezes well: make individual ramekins but before final bake at
  350 °F, instead wrap ramekins in plastic wrap, then foil, and freeze.  To
  cook, remove plastic and replace foil; bake at 350 °F for 45 minutes with
  foil on, 15 minutes with foil off.



## Charred Chili Relleno with Green Rice

Recipe courtesy of Rachael Ray & The Foodnetwork.com, 2007.  Serves 4.  Total
prep time: 45 minutes.

> 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock, divided  
> 1 bay leaf  
> 2 cups white rice  
> 4 large poblano peppers  
> 6 ears corn on the cob or 3 cups frozen corn kernels  
> 3 tablespoons corn, peanut or vegetable oil, divided  
> 1 red onion, chopped  
> 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped  
> 4 cloves garlic, chopped  
> 1 (15-ounce) can fire roasted diced tomatoes, drained well  
> 1½ teaspoons ground cumin, ½ palm full  
> ½ teaspoon dried oregano, eyeball it in your palm  
> Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
> ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves  
> ½ pound spinach leaves, deveined and coarsely chopped  
> 4 scallions, coarsely chopped  
> 2 limes, zested, juiced  
> 1 cup shredded Chihuahua cheese, Asadero or Monterey Jack  

Preheat broiler or grill pan to high. (Don't do this until the poblanos are
ready.) Place poblanos under broiler or on hot grill and char evenly all over,
15 minutes.

Heat about 3½ cups stock in a sauce pot with a bay leaf to boiling. Add rice,
cover pot reduce heat to low and simmer 18 minutes until tender.

While peppers and rice are working, scrape the corn off the cobs or defrost
frozen corn and dry by spreading out on clean kitchen towel. Heat 2 tablespoons
light oil in a skillet over high heat. When the oil smokes or ripples add corn,
onion, jalapenos and toss until the vegetables char at edges and onions are
tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high and add in garlic, fire
roasted tomatoes and season with cumin, oregano, salt and pepper. Cook another
minute or 2 then turn pan off.

Place the cilantro, spinach, scallions, lime zest, half a cup of stock and a
tablespoon of oil in food processor and process into coarse green paste. Stir
into your rice pot in the last 3 to 4 minutes of its cooking time.

Sprinkle the lime juice over the corn mixture.

Split the charred peppers open but not in half with small sharp knife then
scoop out the seeds with a small spoon. Place peppers in a shallow baking dish
and stuff each split pepper with lots of the corn mix, top each pepper with ¼
cup cheese and place back under broiler to melt and char the cheese.

Serve peppers on beds of green rice.

 


## Susan's Spinach and Cheese Curry

Serves 6.

> 2 tablespoons canola oil  
> 1 medium-size red onion, cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced  
> 6-8 medium-size cloves garlic, coarsely chopped  
> 4 lengthwise slices fresh ginger (each 2 inches long, 1 inch wide,  
>   and ⅛ inch thick), coarsely chopped (a 4 inch piece of ginger)  
> 2 T Garam Masala (see Notes)  
> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric  
> 2 tablespoons tomato paste  
> 8 ounces fresh spinach leaves, well rinsed and coarsely chopped  
> 8 ounces fresh mustard greens, well rinsed and finely chopped (see Notes)  
> ½ pound fried paneer, in 1-inch cubes (see Notes)  
> ½ cup heavy cream or half and half  
> 1 teaspoon Garam Masala (see Notes)  
> salt to taste  

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic,
   and ginger, and stir-fry until the onion is light brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
   Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the garam masala and the
   turmeric. (The heat from the browned onion will be just right to cook the
   spices without burning them.)
2. Transfer the mixture to a blender jar, and add the tomato paste and ¼ cup
   water. Puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, to form a smooth,
   reddish-brown paste. Return the paste to the skillet. Pour ¾ cup water into
   the blender jar, and whir the blades to wash it out. Add this to the
   skillet.
3. Place the skillet over medium heat. Pile handfuls of the greens into the
   skillet, cover it, and let the steam wilt them. Stir, and repeat with the
   remaining greens. Once they are all wilted, cover the skillet and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until the greens are broken down to a sauce-like
   consistency and are olive green in color, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Stir in the paneer, cream, and Punjabi garam masala. Add salt to taste.
   Continue simmering the curry, covered, stirring occasionally, until the
   cheese and cream are warmed through, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve warm over rice.

* The original recipe can be found at <http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/spinach-and-mustard-greens-with-cheese>.
* I just use plain garam masala (and in different quantities than the original
  recipe) but you can get fancy (like the original chef of this recipe) and use
  two garam masalas here in different ways. Initially, you add the untoasted
  blend (the *bin bhuna hua garam marsala*) early on, soon after the onion browns,
  to make sure the raw spices cook, providing the first spice layering. Then you
  swirl in the garam masala (ta toasted Punjabi garam masala) toward the end,
  after the curry has cooked. This blend is a finishing spice yielding a second
  tier of flavors that are aromatic, smooth, and assertive. Both blends contain
  similar spices, but what you did with them at various stages creates a
  complex-tasting sauce.
* The original recipe calls for 1¼ lbs. doodh paneer.  I cut this down
  substantially and often times I either buy it pre-fried or just use it
  without frying it.
* The original recipe calls for 1½ teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt, this
  is too salty for our taste.

**How to Prepare Mustard Greens:**

Fresh mustard greens are available in most supermarkets. To prepare them for
cooking, cut out and discard the tough rib that runs through three-quarters
the length of each leaf. Stack 2 or 3 similar-length leaves and roll them
tightly into a tube shape. Cut the tube into thin crosswise slices and unfold
them to yield ribbons (called a chiffonade). Place them in a large bowl.

Once all the greens are sliced, cover them with cold water. Dunk the leaves
briefly under the water. Grab handfuls of the leaves to lift them out of the
water.  The sand or grit will sink to the bottom. Repeat once or twice to
ensure that the leaves are completely clean and grit-free. 

This recipe is friendly to substitution, consider trying other greens such as
radish, carrot, or arugula.



## Bianca Conti-Tronconi's Basil Pesto

Makes about 2 cups of pesto.

> 4 cups basil leaves, washed and dried  
> a pinch of salt  
> ¼ cup virgin olive oil (see below)  
> ¼ cup pine nuts  
> ¼ cup grated parmesan  
> 1 clove garlic, peeled and pressed  

Gently pack basil into a food processor. Add a pinch of salt to keep the basil
from turning black.  Add olive oil, pine nuts, parmesan, and garlic. Cream in
food processor until stiff.

* You may need to add more ingredients (usually olive oil or parmesan) to get
  the desired texture and flavor. Experiment!
* You may prefer the taste of roasted pine nuts. You do you!
* Pesto stores well in the freezer. Freeze in an airtight container with a thin
  layer of olive oil on top of the pesto to prevent freezer burn.


## Portobello Risotto

> 2 T. unsalted butter  
> 2 T. olive oil  
> ½ c. finely chopped onion  
> 1 clove garlic, minced  
> 6 oz. Portobello mushrooms, chopped in ½-inch cubes  
> 1½ c. Arborio rice  
> ½ c. dry white wine  
> 3½  to 4 c. hot chicken broth (low-salt if using canned)  
> 3 T. fresh chopped lemon thyme (regular thyme if you can not find lemon thyme)  
> ½ c. freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano  
> salt and pepper to taste  

Heat butter and olive oil in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add
onion and garlic.  Saute until golden, about 10 minutes.  Add rice and
Portobello mushrooms.  Saute until rice turns translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add white wine, stirring until almost all liquid has evaporated.

Add chicken broth by the ½ c., stirring constantly until all liquid has
evaporated.  Continue adding chicken broth and stirring until the rice is
tender and the mixture is creamy.

## Petits Pains au Chocolat

Bon Appétit, April 2004. Makes 24.

These delicious small pastries are easy to make, and they're sure to disappear quickly.

> 2 sheets frozen puff pastry (one 17.3-ounce package), thawed, each sheet cut into 12 squares

## Hot Fudge Sauce

Gourmet, February 2004. Makes about 2 cups. This recipe takes about 30 minutes
from start to finish.

> ⅔ cup heavy cream  
> ½ cup light corn syrup  
> ⅓ cup packed dark brown sugar  
> ¼ cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder  
> ¼ teaspoon salt  
> 6 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped  
> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
> 1 teaspoon vanilla  

Bring cream, corn syrup, sugar, cocoa, salt, and half of chocolate to a boil in
a 1 to 1 ½-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until chocolate
is melted. Reduce heat and cook at a low boil, stirring occasionally, 5
minutes, then remove from heat. Add butter, vanilla, and remaining chocolate
and stir until smooth. Cool sauce to warm before serving.

* Sauce can be made ahead and cooled completely, then chilled in an airtight
  container or jar. Reheat before using.
* Sauce can be eaten directly from the jar with a spoon, or with your fingers
  in a pinch.
* I have used Baker's chocolate squares and I never chop them.
* This recipe doubles or triples nicely.



## Vanilla sea salt caramel sauce

From *Real Simple*, December 2018. Improvements added by John & Susan.

**Active time:** 45 minutes  
**Total time:** 45 minutes  
**Makes:** 7¼ cups caramel  

Ingredients:

> 5 cups granulated sugar  
> 1½ cups water  
> 3 cups heavy cream  
> 1¼ cups unsalted butter (2½ sticks) , cut into cubes  
> 3 tablespoons pure vanilla extract  
> 1 teaspoon fine sea salt  

* Stir together sugar and 1½ cups water in a large heavy-bottomed pot. Place
  over medium-high and cook, undisturbed, until the sugar begins to turn amber
  around the edge of the pot. This takes about 20 minutes.
* Gently stir the mixture until the color is uniformly amber. This takes about
  5 minutes. Another indication that the mixture is done is that the syrup has
  fewer bubbles at this point, and the bubbles are smaller. Reduce heat to
  low.
* This next step is exciting: slowly stir in the cream. As the cream heats,
  the mixture will bubble and expand dramatically, so be prepared. You should
  use an oven mitt that protects the arm doing the stirring. Continue to cook,
  stirring over low, until caramel is smooth. This takes about 2 minutes.
* Add butter, one piece at a time, whisking constantly until butter is melted
  and incorporated.
* Remove caramel from heat. Stir in vanilla and salt. Serve warm, or let it
  cool. Store in airtight containers.

> Note: if you try to double this recipe, you'll need a really large pot, due
> to the expansion of the mixture when adding the cream.

## Almond-Coconut Chewy Chocolate Cookies

From [Martha Stewart Magazine, April 2019](https://www.marthastewart.com/1537563/almond-coconut-chewy-chocolate-cookies).

Total time: about 2 hours. Makes about 24 cookies.

Ingredients:
 
* 1 2/3 cups almond flour, such as Bob's Red Mill
* 2/3 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter or margarine (for Passover), room temperature
* 1 1/4 cups packed light-brown sugar
* 1 large egg, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate
* 1/2 cup chopped roasted almonds
* 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, and salt.
2. In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter with brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg and vanilla; beat on medium speed just to combine. Reduce speed to low and slowly add flour mixture, beating until combined. Fold in chocolate and almonds. Shape dough into a 1-inch-thick disk, tightly wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place coconut in a shallow dish. Scoop 2 tablespoons (about 1 ounce) dough and form into a ball; roll in coconut to coat. Repeat with remaining dough. Place balls on parchment-lined baking sheets, 1 inch apart; press each lightly to flatten. Bake until cookies are cracked but still slightly soft, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.

> To roast your own almonds, bake them on a rimmed baking sheet
> in a 350 °F oven until fragrant, about 15 minutes.


# Beverages

## Margaritas

Makes about 1 quart (serves 4-6).

> 4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium limes  
> 4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium lemons  
> ¼ cup superfine sugar  
> pinch salt  
> 2 cups crushed ice  
> 1 cup 100 percent agave tequila, preferably reposado  
> 1 cup triple sec  

Combine the lime zest and juice, the lemon zest and juice, sugar and salt in a
large liquid measuring cup. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
flavors meld, 4 to 24 hours.

Divide 1 cup crushed ice between 4-6 margarita or double old-fashioned
glasses. Strain juice mixture into a 1-quart pitcher or cocktail shaker.  Add
tequila, Triple Sec and remaining ice. Stir or shake until thoroughly combined
and chilled – 20-60 seconds. Strain into ice-filled glasses and serve
immediately.

**Fresh Pineapple Margaritas**

> ½ cored and peeled pineapple (about 1 ¾ pounds)

Puree pineapple in food processor or blender until smooth and foamy. Follow
above recipe except omit zest and steeping process, reduce lemon and lime
juices to ¼ cup each and add ½ cup pineapple juice to juice mixture.

**Fresh Berry Margarita**

Follow recipe above except omit zest and steeping process. Puree 1 cup of
raspberries or strawberries with the lemon and lime juices, sugar and salt in
a food processor or blender. Strain juice mixture into a pitcher or cocktail
shaker. Continue with recipe but reduce Triple Sec to ½ cup and add ½ cup
Chambord to juice and tequila mixture.

*Note:* The longer the zest and the juice mixture are allowed to steep, the
more developed the citrus flavors in the finished margaritas. We recommend
steeping the full 24 hours, although the margaritas wills till be great if the
mixture is steeped for only the minimum of 4 hours. If you are in a rush and
want to serve the margaritas immediately, omit the zest and skip the steeping
process altogether.
