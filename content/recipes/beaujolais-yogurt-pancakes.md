Cuisine: american

* 1½ c. whole wheat white flour
* 1½ Tbs. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1½ tsp. baking soda
* 2 eggs
* 2 c. plain low-fat yogurt (I use Greek non-fat)
* ¼ c. canola oil, plus a little for the skillet
* 3 Tbs. cold water

Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda into a
mixing bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients and
add to the fry mixture, stirring lightly to blend.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Pour ¼ c.
of the batter onto the hot surface to form a pancake.  When bubbles come to the
surface of the pancake and the underside is lightly browned, flip the cake and
cook until the other side is lightly browned.

Top with honey-flavored greek yogurt, berries, or maple syrup.
