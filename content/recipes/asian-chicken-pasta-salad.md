Serves 6.

## Creamy sesame dressing

* 1¼ c. mayonnaise (the kind made with olive oil)
* ¼ c. soy sauce
* ¼ c. rice vinegar
* ¼ c. sugar
* ¼ c. sesame oil
* ¼ tsp. black pepper

Combine all ingredients. Makes enough dressing for two salads.

## Salad

* 8 oz. fusilli pasta
* 2 c. cubed cooked chicken
* 4 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1 c. snow peas cut in 1" pieces
* 1 c. halved red grapes
* 1 c. mandarin oranges (1 large can drained)
* 1 8 oz. can sliced button mushrooms, drained
* 3-4 oz. wonton strips (the best come from the deli at Macy's)

1. Cook pasta according to package instructions.  Drain and rinse with cold
   water and drain again.
2. Fill a bowl with ice water.  Bring small pan of water to a boil.  Submerge
   peas in boiling water for no more than 1 minute.  Immediately drain and
   place into the ice water.   (I sometimes just use them raw, especially when
   they are tender)
3. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, snow peas, chicken, green onions,
   mushrooms, grapes and oranges.  Toss well.
4. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
5. Top with wonton strips right before serving.
