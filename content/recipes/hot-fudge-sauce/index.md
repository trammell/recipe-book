## Hot Fudge Sauce

Gourmet, February 2004. Makes about 2 cups. This recipe takes about 30 minutes
from start to finish.


* Sauce can be made ahead and cooled completely, then chilled in an airtight
  container or jar. Reheat before using.
* Sauce can be eaten directly from the jar with a spoon, or with your fingers
  in a pinch.
* I have used Baker's chocolate squares and I never chop them.
* This recipe doubles or triples nicely.
