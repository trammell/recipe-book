## Grilled Chicken Sandwiches with Sage Pesto and Apples

Bon Appétit, July 2003, by Cheryl and Bill Jamison. Makes 6 servings.

**Sage pesto**

> ¾ cup lightly packed fresh sage leaves (from 2 large bunches)
> ¾ cup pine nuts (about 4 ounces)
> ¼ cup (packed) fresh Italian parsley leaves
> 1 garlic clove
> ¾ cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
> 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Using on/off turns, blend sage leaves, pine nuts, parsley, and garlic in
processor until mixture is finely chopped. With machine running, add ¾ cup oil
and blend until thick paste forms. Mix in cheese. Transfer to small bowl;
season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Press plastic wrap onto
surface of pesto and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)

**Sandwiches**

> 6 skinless boneless chicken breast halves
> 6 4x5-inch rectangles focaccia, ciabatta, or long French rolls, split horizontally
> mayonnaise
> 3 medium Fuji apples, halved, cored, thinly sliced

Place each chicken breast between sheets of waxed paper. Using rolling pin or
meat mallet, pound each to ½-inch thickness. Brush chicken with 3 tablespoons
oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let chicken stand 30 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Grill chicken until firm to touch and cooked
through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to platter. Grill focaccia
until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side.

Arrange bottom halves of focaccia on work surface. Spread each with mayonnaise.
Top each with overlapping layer of sliced apple, then 1 chicken breast. Drizzle
each chicken breast with pesto. Spread pesto on cut side of bread tops. Place
tops on chicken, pesto side down. Cut sandwiches in half on diagonal. Transfer
sandwiches to plates and serve.
