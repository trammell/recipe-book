## Vanilla sea salt caramel sauce

From *Real Simple*, December 2018. Improvements added by John & Susan.

**Active time:** 45 minutes  
**Total time:** 45 minutes  
**Makes:** 7¼ cups caramel  

Ingredients:

> 5 cups granulated sugar  
> 1½ cups water  
> 3 cups heavy cream  
> 1¼ cups unsalted butter (2½ sticks) , cut into cubes  
> 3 tablespoons pure vanilla extract  
> 1 teaspoon fine sea salt  

* Stir together sugar and 1½ cups water in a large heavy-bottomed pot. Place
  over medium-high and cook, undisturbed, until the sugar begins to turn amber
  around the edge of the pot. This takes about 20 minutes.
* Gently stir the mixture until the color is uniformly amber. This takes about
  5 minutes. Another indication that the mixture is done is that the syrup has
  fewer bubbles at this point, and the bubbles are smaller. Reduce heat to
  low.
* This next step is exciting: slowly stir in the cream. As the cream heats,
  the mixture will bubble and expand dramatically, so be prepared. You should
  use an oven mitt that protects the arm doing the stirring. Continue to cook,
  stirring over low, until caramel is smooth. This takes about 2 minutes.
* Add butter, one piece at a time, whisking constantly until butter is melted
  and incorporated.
* Remove caramel from heat. Stir in vanilla and salt. Serve warm, or let it
  cool. Store in airtight containers.

> Note: if you try to double this recipe, you'll need a really large pot, due
> to the expansion of the mixture when adding the cream.
