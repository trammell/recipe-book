## Lacinato Kale and Ricotta Salata Salad

Gourmet, January 2007.  Makes 6 servings.  Total time: 25 minutes.

Inspired by an antipasto that's popular at New York City's Lupa, this
substantial salad takes a hearty, rich green that's usually cooked and proves
how delicious it can be when served raw.

> ¾ to 1 pound lacinato kale (also called Tuscan kale) or tender regular kale,
> stems and center ribs discarded
> 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot
> 1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice
> ¼ teaspoon salt
> ¼ teaspoon black pepper
> 4 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
> 2 ounces coarsely grated ricotta salata (1 cup)

Working in batches, cut kale crosswise into very thin slices.  Whisk together
shallot, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow
stream, whisking until combined well.

Toss kale and ricotta salata in a large bowl with enough dressing to coat well,
then season with salt and pepper.
