Makes 10 servings. Prep time: about 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup hazelnuts
* ¼ cup white balsamic or white wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1¼ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ½ cup olive oil
* 1 large bunch red kale, ribs removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces (about 10 cups)
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and shredded in a food processor (about 6 cups)
* 1 cup pomegranate seeds

## Directions

1. Roast hazelnuts for 8-12 minutes in a 350°F oven. Nuts should be in a single
   layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Remove when golden brown and fragrant, let
   cool, then rub hazelnuts between your fingers to loosen skins. Discard
   skins. Roughly chop hazelnuts.
2. Whisk vinegar, honey, salt, mustard, and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly
   whisk in oil. Toss kale and Brussels sprouts with ¼ cup dressing in a large
   bowl. Using your hands, massage dressing into kale mixture until leaves are
   slightly softened and shiny, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add
   pomegranate seeds and remaining dressing and toss to combine. Serve
   immediately or refrigerate overnight.

Just before serving, add hazelnuts and toss to combine.

## Notes

* The original recipe says this makes 8 servings; it makes more than that.
* I buy _Trader Joe's_ dry roasted & unsalted Oregon Hazelnuts to avoid having
  to roast the nuts.
* The original recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of honey.
* Peach white balsamic vinegar works well instead of white wine vinegar.
* It can be difficult to find red kale. I usually substitute dinosaur
  (lacinato) kale and chiffonade the leaves.
* I usually double the pomegranate seeds and add extra hazelnuts.
