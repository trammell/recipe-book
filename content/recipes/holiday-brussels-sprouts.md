Makes 8 servings. Prep time: about 30 minutes.

> 1 cup hazelnuts
> ¼ cup white balsamic or white wine vinegar
> 2 tablespoons honey
> 1¼ teaspoon kosher salt
> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
> ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
> ½ cup olive oil
> 1 large bunch red kale, ribs removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces (about 10 cups)
> 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and shredded in a food processor (about 6 cups)
> 1 cup pomegranate seeds
> 2 cups butter and herb croutons

Roast hazelnuts for 8-12 minutes in a 350°F oven. Nuts should be in a single
layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Remove when golden brown and fragrant, let
cool, then rub hazelnuts between your fingers to loosen skins. Discard skins.
Roughly chop hazelnuts.

Whisk vinegar, honey, salt, mustard, and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk
in oil. Toss kale and Brussels sprouts with ¼ cup dressing in a large bowl.
Using your hands, massage dressing into kale mixture until leaves are slightly
softened and shiny, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add pomegranate
seeds and remaining dressing and toss to combine. Serve immediately or
refrigerate overnight.

Just before serving, add croutons and hazelnuts and toss to combine.
