## Salsa Verde

Harmony Valley Farms Salsa Verde; yields 1½ cups.  

> 6-8 tomatillos (about 12 oz)
> 1 clove garlic
> 1 small onion
> 1 jalapeño, as desired
> A few sprigs of cilantro
> Salt and ground black pepper, to taste

In a small saucepan, bring 4-5 cups water to a boil. Remove husks from
tomatillos and rinse fruit. Boil tomatillos for about 5 minutes or just until
softened.

In the bowl of a food processor, put tomatillos and the rest of the
ingredients. For a medium heat salsa, use about ½ of the jalapeño with
seeds. Adjust the amount of jalapeño to your liking. Blend until the mixture
is a coarse puree.

Refrigerate for 1-2 hours to allow flavors to meld. Adjust seasoning and serve
with tortilla chips, tacos, enchiladas, etc.
