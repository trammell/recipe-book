_Gourmet_, May 1993. Makes 12 muffins. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

* 1 cup yellow cornmeal
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* ½ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1¼ cups plain yogurt
* ½ stick (¼ cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 1 cup fresh raspberries

Preheat the oven to 375 °F and butter well twelve ½-cup muffin tins. In a bowl
whisk together the cornmeal, the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, the
baking soda, and the salt. In another bowl whisk together the eggs, the yogurt,
and the butter, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just
combined.

Fold in the raspberries gently, divide the batter among the muffin tins, and
bake the muffins in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester
comes out clean. Let the muffins cool in the tins on a rack for 3 minutes, turn
them out onto the rack, and let them cool completely. The muffins may be made 1
day in advance and kept in an airtight container.
