Total time: about 2 hours. Makes about 24 cookies.

## Ingredients

* 1 2/3 cups almond flour, such as Bob's Red Mill
* 2/3 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter or margarine (for Passover), room temperature
* 1 1/4 cups packed light-brown sugar
* 1 large egg, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate
* 1/2 cup chopped roasted almonds
* 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, and salt.
2. In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat
   butter with brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy,
   about 5 minutes. Add egg and vanilla; beat on medium speed just to
   combine. Reduce speed to low and slowly add flour mixture, beating
   until combined. Fold in chocolate and almonds. Shape dough into a 1-inch-thick disk, tightly wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place coconut in a shallow dish. Scoop 2
   tablespoons (about 1 ounce) dough and form into a ball; roll in coconut to coat. Repeat with remaining dough. Place balls on parchment-lined baking sheets, 1 inch apart; press each lightly to flatten. Bake until cookies are cracked but still slightly soft, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.

To roast your own almonds, bake them on a rimmed baking sheet
in a 350 Â°F oven until fragrant, about 15 minutes.
