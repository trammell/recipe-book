Prep time: about 1 hour. Yields about 3 cups. Serves about 4.

## Ingredients

Sauce:

* ⅓ cup coconut aminos
* 3 tablespoons peanut butter
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
* ½ teaspoon sriracha

Filling:

* 1 pound ground chicken
* 1 cup onions, finely chopped
* 1 bell pepper, finely chopped
* 1 cup broccoli, finely chopped
* 1 cup chopped finely cabbage
* 1 cup carrots, shredded

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground chicken until done,
   about 10 minutes. Set the chicken aside.
2. Heat some olive oil in the skillet. Cook the vegetables until done, 5-10
   minutes.
3. Combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl with a whisk or small blender. Feel
   free to experiment with the ingredient proportions.
4. Combine the sauce, chicken, and vegetables. Salt to taste.

Serve on lettuce leaves (bibb works well) or as a side salad.

## Notes

* Substitute tamari or soy sauce for coconut aminos if you like. Dial back the
  salt accordingly.
* The filling is very flexible! Consider adding whatever vegetables you like or
  have on hand, or even nuts or fruits.
* Consider using green or red onions in the vegetable filling.
* I generally like a little more sesame oil and sriracha.
