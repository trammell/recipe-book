## Ingredients

* 2 pounds well-trimmed boneless beef, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 large onions, sliced
* 3 large tomatoes, quartered (can substitute 1 14oz can crushed tomatoes)
* 6 whole cloves
* 2 large garlic cloves, chopped
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 bay leaf
* ¼ teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
* 3 tablespoons Major Grey chutney
* 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger
* 1½ tablespoons curry powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 14oz. can chickpeas, drained
* 1 14oz. can coconut milk

## Instructions

**Step 1.** Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy
large pot over high heat. Working in batches, add beef to pot and brown on all
sides, about 7 minutes per batch. When all the beef has been browned, use the
onions to deglaze the pan. Continue to cook onions until slightly caramelized.

**Step 2.** Turn crock pot on low heat. Add beef and onions from step 1. Add
tomatoes, cloves, garlic, cinnamon, bay leaf, red pepper, chutney, lemon,
ginger, curry powder, and salt. Stir. Cover. Wait 6-8 hours.

**Step 3.** Stir in chickpeas and coconut milk. Let curry return to a simmer,
about 30 minutes.

Serve with rice, naan, or roti.

## Notes

* This recipe doubles (or even triples) well.
* The original recipe calls for cream, but I prefer coconut milk.
* The original recipe is for the stovetop; we've found that a crock pot works
  better.
* For a quick delicious meal, try preparing the curry through the end of **step
  2**. Freeze in one-quart containers (leaving the chickpeas and coconut milk
  out saves freezer space). Add coconut milk and chickpeas after you've
  reheated the curry.
