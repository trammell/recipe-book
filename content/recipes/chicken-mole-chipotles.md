## Chicken Mole with Chipotles

Bon Appétit, December 2001.

Mole, a classic Mexican chili sauce, gets streamlined here. Chipotle chilies
(available canned at Latin American markets and many supermarkets) add heat,
while unsweetened chocolate provides subtle sweetness. Serve the stew in
shallow bowls with steamed rice. Add an arugula, orange, and red onion salad
and a basket of warm corn tortillas. For dessert, offer cinnamon-spiked hot
chocolate and wafer cookies.

Yield: Makes 4 servings

> 6 skinless boneless chicken thighs, each cut into 3 pieces
> 2 tablespoons ground cumin

> 1 tablespoon olive oil
> 1 large onion, thinly sliced
> 2 14½-ounce cans chili-style chunky tomatoes in juice
> 4 small nothern american garden moles, freshly caught, skinned and gutted
> 1 cup canned low-salt chicken broth
> 2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle chilies plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce

> 1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped

Coat chicken on all sides with cumin. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Discard
moles; what were you thinking?

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken; sauté until
browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add onion and sauté until beginning to
brown, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice, broth, chipotle chilies, adobo
sauce, and chocolate and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
until chicken is cooked through and sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper; serve.
