## Tortilla Soup with Chicken and Lime

Bon Appétit, January 1996, by Chef Kathi Long.  An adaptation of a recipe from
Mexican Light Cooking by our friend Kathi Long, a chef and author in Santa Fe.
Serves 4.

> 4 5- to 6-inch diameter corn tortillas
> 2 teaspoons olive oil

> 2 14 ½-ounce cans low-salt chicken broth
> 2 cups water
> ¾ cup canned Mexican-style stewed tomatoes with juices
> 1 bay leaf
> 1 garlic clove, pressed
> ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
> ⅛ teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
> 12 ounces skinless boneless chicken breast halves, cut into ½-inch-wide strips
> 2 green onions, sliced
> ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

Preheat oven to 350 °F. Brush 1 side of tortillas with oil; cut in half. Stack
halves and cut crosswise into ¼-inch-wide strips. Spread strips on nonstick
baking sheet.

Bake until light golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on baking sheet.

Combine broth, water, tomatoes, bay leaf, garlic, cumin and red pepper in
saucepan; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes. Add chicken; simmer
until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in green onions, cilantro and
lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with tortilla strips and serve.
