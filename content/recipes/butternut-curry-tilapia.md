## Butternut Squash Curry with Tilapia

By Rachel Fishman Feddersen, Parenting.com.  A quick and easy weeknight dinner
idea using boxed soup, tilapia and prepared curry paste.


Serves: 4
Total time: 20 minutes

> 1 box butternut squash soup
> 1 to 2 Tbsp (or to taste) Thai red curry paste (or leftover sauce from Thai takeout)
> 1 lb tilapia fillet
> ¼ to ½ lb green beans, trimmed

Heat soup in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the curry paste or
leftover sauce.  Reduce to medium heat. Add the fish and cook, without boiling,
for 8 to 10 minutes, until fish is white and flaky.

Steam the beans in about 1 inch of water. Add to the soup just before serving
over rice, noodles, or couscous.

Picky Eater Pleaser: Deconstruct it. Heat some of the soup plain and serve
with the tilapia and some steamed green beans.
