## Petits Pains au Chocolat

Bon Appétit, April 2004. Makes 24.

These delicious small pastries are easy to make, and they're sure to disappear quickly.

> 2 sheets frozen puff pastry (one 17.3-ounce package), thawed, each sheet cut into 12 squares
> 1 large egg beaten to blend with 1 Tb water (for glaze)
> 4 3½-ounce bars imported bittersweet or milk chocolate, each cut into six 2x¾-inch pieces
> sugar

Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Brush top of each puff pastry square
with egg glaze. Place 1 chocolate piece on edge of 1 pastry square. Roll up
dough tightly, enclosing chocolate. Repeat with remaining pastry and chocolate.
Place pastry rolls on baking sheet, seam side down. (Can be made 1 day ahead.
Cover pastries with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cover and refrigerate
remaining egg glaze.)

Preheat oven to 400 °F. Brush tops of pastry rolls with remaining egg glaze.
Sprinkle lightly with sugar. Bake until pastries are golden brown, about 15
minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

* These are also good filled with jam or jam and cream cheese
