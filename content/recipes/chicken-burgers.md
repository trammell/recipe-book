## Chicken Burgers

Makes 5 generous servings.

> ¾ c. panko bread crumbs  
> ⅓ c. buttermilk  
> ⅓ tsp. black pepper  
> ⅓ tsp cayenne pepper  
> ¼ tsp. salt  
> 20 oz chicken, ground  

Mix all ingredients together.  Grill on a griddle sprayed lightly with oil.

* Goes well with coleslaw (see next recipe).
* These do not grill well on an outdoor grill, as they are quite moist.
* Other varieties (e.g. chipotle) of pepper work also.  Use more pepper for a spicier burger!
