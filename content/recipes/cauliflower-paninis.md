Originally from [Blue Apron][ba].

## Ingredients

[ciabs]: https://www.breadsmith.com/product/ciabatta/

* 4 sandwich rolls (mini [ciabattas from Breadsmith][ciabs] work well), halved
* florets from 1 head of cauliflower, washed and dried
* 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 28-oz can whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 bunch parsley
* 8 oz. mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
* ⅓ cup grated parmesan cheese
* red pepper flakes

## Directions

* Preheat the oven to 450°.
* Drizzle cauliflower with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in
  the oven until lightly browned, 15-20 minutes.
* In a large nonstick pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until
  hot. Add the garlic, add red pepper flakes to taste. Season with salt and
  pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant.
  Add the tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Break up the tomatoes with
  spatula. Cook, stirring occasionally, 12 to 14 minutes, or until slightly
  thickened. Turn off the heat and stir in all but a pinch of the parsley.
  Transfer to a bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste.
* Rinse and wipe out the pan. (You'll need it later.)

### Assemble and cook the paninis

* Spread a layer of the sauce onto the cut sides of the rolls. You should have
  sauce left over.
* Top with all but a pinch of the parmesan cheese. Evenly divide the roasted
  cauliflower and mozzarella cheese between the roll bottoms; season with salt
  and pepper. Complete with the rolltops.
* In a large nonstick pan (possibly the one you used earlier), heat a drizzle
  of olive oil on medium. Add the paninis. Place another heavy pan on top of
  the paninis to squash them down. Cook, occasionally pressing down, about 8
  minutes per side, or until the rolls are browned and crispy and the cheese
  has melted. Add olive oil before flipping sandwiches if needed.

Serve the sandwiches with the left over sauce on the side. Garnish with any
left over parmesan and parsley. Offer left over sauce for dipping.
