## Szechuan Noodles with Peanut Sauce

Bon Appétit, August 1999, from Zygot Bookworks & Cafe.  Serves 6 as a main
course.

> ½ cup (or more) canned vegetable broth  
> 1 cup super-chunky peanut butter  
> ¼ cup soy sauce  
> 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar  
> 1½ tablespoons chili-garlic sauce  
> 5 garlic cloves, minced  

> 12 ounces dried chow mein udon (Asian-style noodles)  
> 1 tablespoon canola oil  

> 8 large bok choy leaves  
> 2 red bell peppers, halved lengthwise  
> 2 large carrots, peeled  
> 1 bunch green onions  

> 2 cups shredded Napa cabbage  
> 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds  

Sauce, noodles and vegetables can be prepared ahead of time. Cover them
separately and store in the refrigerator. Bring the sauce to room temperature
before combining with noodles, vegetables, and cabbage, thinning with
additional broth if necessary.

* Mix ½ cup vegetable broth, peanut butter, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar,
  chili-garlic sauce and minced garlic in medium bowl to blend well. The sauce
  should be thick.
* Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but
  still firm to bite, about 6 minutes. Drain. Rinse noodles under cold water
  and cool. Cut noodles into 4- to 5-inch lengths. Transfer noodles to very
  large bowl. Toss with oil to coat.
* Cut bok choy, peppers, carrots and onions into matchstick-size strips.
* Add shredded cabbage and vegetable strips to noodles. Toss with enough
  peanut sauce to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

> Udon is available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of many
> supermarkets.
