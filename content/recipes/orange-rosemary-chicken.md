## Orange-Rosemary Chicken

Williams-Sonoma Kitchen, Bon Appétit, July 1997. Serves 6. Total prep time: 45
minutes.


> 1 12-ounce container frozen orange juice from concentrate, thawed  
> ⅓ cup dry white wine  
> ⅓ cup honey-Dijon mustard  
> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried  
> 4 teaspoons soy sauce  
> 2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)  
> 1 large garlic clove, chopped  

> 1 cup hickory smoke chips, soaked in water 30 minutes, drained  
> small (8" x 6") foil container (make out of tinfoil in a pinch)
> 2 7-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces (breasts halved if large)  

Blend first 7 ingredients in processor to make the orange glaze. Set glaze
aside.

Preheat grill to medium. Place smoke chips in foil container with open top.
Set chips atop coals about 5 minutes before grilling. Sprinkle chicken with
salt and pepper. Grill chicken until golden, turning occasionally, about 5
minutes per side. Continue grilling chicken until cooked through, brushing
glaze over chicken and turning occasionally, about 25 minutes longer.
Transfer to platter.

* It's almost as quick to make the citrus-herb glaze that coats the chicken as
  it is to open a bottle of barbecue sauce--and the glaze has a far more
  interesting taste!
* Pour a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc for the grown-ups; the kids should have
  lemonade. Finish up with watermelon and brownies.
