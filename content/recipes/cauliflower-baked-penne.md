Bon Appétit, October 2008, by Bruce Aidells (adapted by Susan).  One of
Adeline's favorites.  Makes 8 servings.

> 1 large head of cauliflower, cored, cut into 1-inch florets
> 2 large heirloom tomatoes
> 5 tablespoons butter, divided
> ½ cup thinly sliced green onions
> coarse kosher salt
> 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
> 1 cup heavy whipping cream
> 3 cups coarsely grated Comté cheese (or half Gruyère and half Fontina; about 9 ounces), divided
> ¾ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
> 1 cup sour cream
> 1 tablespoon whole grain Dijon mustard
> 10 ounces penne (approx. 3½ cups)
> 1 cup Panko crumbs

Cook cauliflower in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about
5 minutes. Using large sieve, transfer cauliflower to bowl. Add tomatoes to
pot; cook 1 minute. Remove from water; peel and dice tomatoes. Reserve pot of
water.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
cauliflower; sauté until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and
green onions. Cook 1 minute to blend flavors. Remove from heat. Season with
coarse salt and pepper.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and
stir 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in cream. Cook until sauce thickens, whisking
occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add 2 cups Comté cheese; whisk until melted and
sauce is smooth. Whisk in ½ cup Parmesan, then sour cream and mustard.
Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.

Return reserved pot of water to boil. Add pasta and cook until tender but still
firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain; return pasta to same pot. Stir in
cauliflower mixture and sauce.

Butter 13×9×2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon in half of pasta mixture; sprinkle
with ½ cup Comté cheese. Top with remaining pasta mixture and ½ cup Comté
cheese. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in small skillet. Add breadcrumbs
and toss to coat. Remove from heat; mix in ¼ cup Parmesan. Sprinkle crumbs
over pasta. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead.

Let stand at room temperature.  Preheat oven to 350 °F. Bake pasta uncovered
until heated through and bubbling, about 35 minutes.  Broil 1-2 minutes if
topping needs help browning.

* Instead of making in one large dish, consider instead baking your pasta in
  an equivalent number of ramekins. This way you can customize your dish if
  you have any picky eaters!
* This dish freezes well: make individual ramekins but before final bake at
  350 °F, instead wrap ramekins in plastic wrap, then foil, and freeze.  To
  cook, remove plastic and replace foil; bake at 350 °F for 45 minutes with
  foil on, 15 minutes with foil off.
