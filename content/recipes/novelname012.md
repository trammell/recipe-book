## Hot and Sour Soup

Adapted from Williams-Sonoma Collection Series, _Soup_, by Diane Rossen
Worthington (Simon & Schuster, 2001). 

To rehydrate dried whole mushrooms, place them in a bowl, add boiling water to
cover and let soak for 30 minutes, until soft. For dried mushroom slices,
reduce the soaking time to 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well. For extra mushroom
flavor, reserve the soaking liquid and add it to the dish. Before using, strain
the liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter to remove
any grit.

Accompany the soup with a shredded cabbage salad dressed with rice wine
vinegar, sugar and a little oil.

> 1 oz. dried Chinese black mushrooms or dried shiitake mushrooms  
> 3 cups boiling water  
> 2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. white wine vinegar  
> 1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. soy sauce  
> ½ tsp. Asian sesame oil  
> 1 ¼ tsp. Asian chili oil  
> ½ tsp. freshly ground pepper, plus more, to taste  
> 5 cups chicken stock  
> ½ cup canned thinly sliced bamboo shoots, rinsed and drained  
> 1 boneless, skinless whole chicken breast, about ½ lb., cut crosswise into thin bite-size slices  
> ¼ lb. firm tofu, drained and cut into ½- inch cubes  
> 2 Tbs. cornstarch  
> ¼ cup water  
> 1 egg, well beaten  

Soak the dried mushrooms in the boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain the
mushrooms and slice them thinly. Set aside.

In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil
and the ½ tsp. pepper. Set aside.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Add the
mushrooms and bamboo shoots and cook until the stock is aromatic, about 3
minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken and tofu. Cook until the
chicken is just opaque throughout and the tofu is heated through, about 2
minutes. Add the reserved vinegar-soy mixture and bring to a simmer.

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water and stir until the cornstarch
is dissolved. Add to the soup and stir until the soup begins to thicken. Remove
from the heat. Add the egg, whisking with a fork until little shreds of cooked
egg form. Taste and adjust the seasonings with vinegar, pepper or soy sauce.

Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and serve immediately.
