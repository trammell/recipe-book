## Portobello Risotto

> 2 T. unsalted butter
> 2 T. olive oil
> ½ c. finely chopped onion
> 1 clove garlic, minced
> 6 oz. Portobello mushrooms, chopped in ½-inch cubes
> 1½ c. Arborio rice
> ½ c. dry white wine
> 3½  to 4 c. hot chicken broth (low-salt if using canned)
> 3 T. fresh chopped lemon thyme (regular thyme if you can not find lemon thyme)
> ½ c. freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
> salt and pepper to taste

Heat butter and olive oil in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add
onion and garlic.  Saute until golden, about 10 minutes.  Add rice and
Portobello mushrooms.  Saute until rice turns translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add white wine, stirring until almost all liquid has evaporated.

Add chicken broth by the ½ c., stirring constantly until all liquid has
evaporated.  Continue adding chicken broth and stirring until the rice is
tender and the mixture is creamy.
