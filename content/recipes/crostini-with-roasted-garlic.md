Bon Appétit, October 1999.  From the 128 Cafe, St. Paul, Minnesota.  Makes 8
Servings

Kari and Brian Chase of St. Paul, Minnesota say that their neighborhood has a
great restaurant: 128 Cafe. The last time they were there they tried a
delicious appetizer of crisp bread with roasted garlic, goat cheese and apple
chutney.

> 1 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
> ¾ cup rice vinegar
> 2 garlic cloves, minced
> 1½ teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger
> ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
> 1 cinnamon stick
> 1½ pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, cut into ½-inch pieces (about 4 cups)
> 1 cup golden raisins
> 1 cup diced seeded plum tomatoes
> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

> 1 French-bread baguette, cut into ⅓-inch-thick slices
> Olive oil
> Roasted Garlic
> 12 ounces soft fresh goat cheese (such as Montrachet), room temperature

Stir sugar and vinegar in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until sugar
dissolves. Add next 4 ingredients and simmer until mixture is syrupy and
reduced to ½ cup, about 8 minutes. Mix in apples and raisins. Increase heat to
high and boil until apples are tender, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.
Cool to room temperature. (Chutney can be made 3 days ahead; cover and
refrigerate.) Mix in tomatoes and mint.

Preheat oven to 450 °F. Arrange baguette slices on baking sheet and brush with
olive oil. Bake until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes. Spread each toast with
roasted garlic; top with goat cheese and chutney.

* At the restaurant, the bread is grilled, but it's just as good when it's baked.
* A good jarred apple chutney or pear chutney works just as well
