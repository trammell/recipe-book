## Roasted Carrots and Parsnips with White Balsamic

Bon Appétit, November 2010, by Diane Morgan. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  Total
time: 1 hour 30 minutes.

The technique: Roasting is as basic as baking something uncovered, but this
simple process does something magical to vegetables.

The payoff: Roasting caramelizes the sugars and creates veggies that are
browned on the outside and tender on the inside.

> 2¼ pounds medium parsnips, trimmed, peeled, cut into 3x½-inch sticks
> 1½ pounds medium carrots, trimmed, peeled, cut into 3x½-inch sticks
> ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
> 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
> 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
> 2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
> 1 teaspoon black pepper

Preheat oven to 425 °F. Combine parsnips and carrots on large rimmed baking
sheet. Add oil and remaining ingredients; toss to coat. Spread in even layer on
baking sheet.

Roast until vegetables are tender and brown around edges, stirring
occasionally, about 50 minutes to 1 hour.

Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature
1 hour, then rewarm in 400 °F oven 15 minutes.
