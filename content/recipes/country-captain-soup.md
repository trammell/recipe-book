Bon Appétit, March 1995. Adapted by Susan. Serves 6.

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
* ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
* 4 garlic cloves, chopped
* 6 skinless boneless chicken thighs (about 1¼ pounds), cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
* ¼ teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
* 4 cups (or more) canned chicken broth
* 2 cups canned diced peeled tomatoes with juices
* 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, coarsely chopped
* ½ cup orzo (rice-shaped pasta; also called riso)
* 2 tablespoons dried currants
* chopped fresh cilantro
* plain yogurt

Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell
pepper and garlic; sauté until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add chicken,
curry powder, ginger and crushed red pepper; stir 2 minutes. Add 4 cups broth,
tomatoes and apple and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. (Can
be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Stir orzo and currants into soup and simmer until orzo is just cooked through,
about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish
with cilantro and dollop of yogurt.
