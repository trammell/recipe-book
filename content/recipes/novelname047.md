servings.

> "An Indian friend of my mother's gave her this recipe for beef curry back in

> 60 years later."

> 2 pounds well-trimmed boneless beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces  
> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
> 2 large onions, sliced  
> 6 whole cloves  
> 2 large garlic cloves, chopped  
> 2 cinnamon sticks  
> 1 bay leaf  
> ¼ teaspoon dried crushed red pepper  
> 1½ cups whole milk (can substitute coconut milk)  
> 3 large tomatoes, quartered (can substitute crushed canned tomatoes)  
> 1 14-oz can chick peas or equivalent  
> 3 tablespoons Major Grey chutney  
> 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  
> 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger  
> 1½ tablespoons curry powder  
> ½ teaspoon salt  

> hot cooked rice  

Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot
over high heat. Working in batches, add beef to pot and brown on all sides,
about 7 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer to plate.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add onions;
sauté until tender and brown, about 7 minutes. Return beef to pot. Add cloves,
garlic, cinnamon sticks, bay leaf and dried red pepper to pot; stir 1 minute.
Stir in milk, tomatoes, chutney, lemon juice, ginger, curry powder and ½
teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until beef is
tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Uncover; increase heat to medium.   Add chickpeas.  Boil stew until juices are
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.  Serve over rice with naan and samosas.

* This recipe doubles or even triples well.  It also reheats well. Try freezing
  in 1-qt containers, then thawing and warming on the stove (takes about 20
  minutes) for a quick but good mid-week meal.

Alternative crock-pot cooking method:

* Prepare onions and beef as above (this can be done the night before).
* Cook all ingredients except milk and chickpeas in crock pot on low for
  approximately 8 hours.
* Stir in milk and cooked chickpeas, warm and serve.
