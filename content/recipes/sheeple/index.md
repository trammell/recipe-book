### COVID's answer to the Gin and Tonic

The origin of the Gin and Tonic as a way to take bitter antimalarial
quinine is well known [1][1] [2][2]. But what are you going to do *this*
century to say healthy and own the libs at the same time? HUH? You're
going to drink a *Sheeple*, that's what.

### Ivermectin syrup

The key ingredient to a good Sheeple is the ivermectin syrup. Buy the
yummy apple-flavored kind. Each marking on the plunger is a dose for
250 pounds of horse, or one average red-State American.

* 1 dose of apple-flavored ivermectin
* 3 oz. agave nectar

Muddle ivermectin and agave nectar; store in an airtight container.
