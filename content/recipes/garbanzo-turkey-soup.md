_Bon Appétit_, March 1995. Serves 6.

Sliced or diced fresh avocado makes a colorful garnish for this hearty
southwestern soup. If you want to cut up the avocado ahead of time but don't
want it to discolor, simply place the avocado pieces in a colander and rinse
them with cold water. They will stay bright green for about two hours.

* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ¾ pound turkey sausage, casings removed, crumbled
* 8 large garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 cup canned diced peeled tomatoes with juices
* 2 tablespoons thinly sliced seeded jalapeño chili
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary or ½ teaspoon dried
* 3 15- to 16-ounce cans garbanzo beans (chick-peas), undrained
* 2 cups canned chicken broth or beef broth
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 avocado, peeled, sliced

Heat olive oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add turkey
sausage and chopped garlic and sauté until sausage is golden brown and cooked
through, breaking up sausage with back of fork, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to
medium. Add tomatoes with their juices, sliced jalapeño chili, ground cumin and
chopped fresh rosemary and simmer 10 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add garbanzo beans with their liquid and chicken broth and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer soup 15 minutes. Stir in fresh lemon juice. Season soup
to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before continuing.)

Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle soup with chopped fresh cilantro and top with
sliced avocado. Serve immediately.
