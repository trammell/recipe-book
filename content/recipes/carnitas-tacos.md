_Bon Appétit_, April 2008, by Amy Finely. Makes 4 servings.

You'll need a slow cooker for this recipe (a necessity for any busy cook).

* 2 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs or pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 1 ½-inch pieces
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
* ½ large onion, cut into 4 pieces
* 1 avocado, halved, pitted, sliced
* Fresh cilantro sprigs
* Sliced red bell peppers (optional)
* Corn tortillas
* Roasted Tomatillo Salsa

Toss pork in bowl of slow cooker with salt, black pepper, and dried oregano to
coat. Place onion pieces atop pork. Cover slow cooker and cook pork on low
setting until meat is very tender and falling apart, about 6 hours.

Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to cutting board. Discard onion pieces.
Using fingers, shred pork; transfer carnitas to platter. Place avocado slices,
cilantro sprigs, and sliced red bell peppers, if desired, alongside. Wrap corn
tortillas in damp kitchen towel; microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Serve
carnitas with warm tortillas and tomatillo salsa.
