## Louisiana Red Beans and Rice

(Tyler Florence recipe from the foodnetwork.com)  
Serves: 6 servings

> 1 pound dried small red beans, picked over and rinsed  
> 2 large smoked ham shanks  
> 1 large yellow onion, chopped  
> 2 celery stalks, chopped  
> 1 large green bell pepper, chopped  
> 1 teaspoon cayenne  
> ¼ bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped  
> 2 sprigs fresh thyme  
> 3 bay leaves  
> 4 garlic cloves, chopped  
> 2 green onions, green part only, chopped, plus more for garnish  
> red pepper sauce  
> 2 andouille sausages, sliced thin  
> 4 cups cooked white rice  

Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak the beans
overnight in the refrigerator.

Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot with the ham hocks, adding
just enough cold water to cover (about 2 quarts). Add the onion, celery,
cayenne, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, green onions, and several shakes
of red pepper sauce; give everything a good stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered,
until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 2½ hours.  You want
the beans to be almost overcooked, like they are getting ready to burst. Stir
the beans occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot. Add about
1 cup of water toward the end of cooking if the mixture appears too thick or
dry.

Mash about 1 cup of the cooked beans against the side of the pot with a wooden
spoon, this makes the broth thick and creamy. Toss in the sausages and green
pepper and cook for another 30 minutes. Adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve
the red beans in a wide bowl over some steamed white rice and garnished with
chopped green onion.
