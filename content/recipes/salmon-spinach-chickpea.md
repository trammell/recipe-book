From Martha Stewart. Approximately 30 minutes, serves 4.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1 garlic clove, chopped
* 1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 boneless, skinnless salmon fillets, preferably wild sockeye
  (5 oz. each, 1 in. thick)
* coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
* ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 5 c. baby spinach (6½ oz.)
* 1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut out four 12x17 inch pieces of parchment; fold each
in half crosswise to form a crease, then open.

Season salmon with salt and red pepper flakes. Pulse parsley, garlic, and oil
in food processor until it forms a rough paste. Rub salmon with paste. Divide
spinach and chickpeas evenly among the 4 parchment pieces, season with salt and
pepper. Lay 1 fillet on top of each. Fold parchment over ingredients; make
overlapping pleats to seal.

Bake on baking sheet for 9-10 minutes (medium rare) or 11-12 minutes for
medium.

## Notes

* Fillets do not have to be skinless, but the original recipe calls for it.
* Smaller fillets (3-4 oz.) also work.
* Substitute whatever cooked beans you have handy if necessary
