Serves 6.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups rolled oats
* 2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 cups brown sugar
* 6 tablespoons butter, cold
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 2 cups frozen blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Oil a 9x13-inch baking pan with 2-inch sides.
2. In a large bowl combine oats, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and brown sugar.
   Mix well. Using a cheese grater, shred the cold butter into the mix. Work the butter
   in until the size of grains of rice.
3. In a medium bowl, combine milk, lemon juice, and vanilla. Stir into the oat mixture
   and mix well.
4. Press a little more than half of the dough into the oiled baking pan.
5. In a food processor, mix the sugar and cornstarch well. Add half of the berries
   and blend. Stir the remaining whole berries into the blended mix, then spread the
   mixture over the oat batter in the pan. "Dollop" the remaining batter evenly over
   the fruit mixture. Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until the top is golden and the
   fruit is bubbling.
6. Remove the bars from the oven. Let them cool in their baking dish on a rack. When cool,
   cut into 3"x6" squares (about 18 bars). Wrap individually in saran or foil for
   an easy treat. Can be eaten frozen, or after they thaw in (about an hour).
