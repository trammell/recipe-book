## Pork Tenderloin with Herbed Breadcrumb Crust

Bon Appétit, September 1998.  Serves 8.

Simple, appealing and perfect with the polenta. Pour a Barbera or Pinot Bianco.

> 6 cups fresh breadcrumbs made from French bread  
> ⅔ cup chopped fresh parsley  
> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary  
> 1¾ teaspoons crumbled bay leaves  

> 3 pounds pork tenderloins, trimmed  
> 2 large eggs, beaten to blend  

> 4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter  
> 2 tablespoons olive oil  

Preheat oven to 375 °F. Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Season
to taste with salt and pepper.

Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Dip into eggs, then into breadcrumb
mixture, coating completely.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add half of pork; cook until golden on all sides, about 5
minutes. Place on rack set in large roasting pan. Wipe out skillet. Repeat with
remaining 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon oil and pork.
