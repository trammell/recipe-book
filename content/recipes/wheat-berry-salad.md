Originally from [_Gourmet_][epi] magazine, July 1994. Prep time: 45 minutes.
Serves 8 to 10.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup wheat berries  
- 1 cup pearl barley  
- 1 small red onion, chopped fine  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced and mashed to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon salt  
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar  
- 1/4 cup olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)  
- 6 scallions, chopped fine  
- 1 1/2 cups cooked corn (cut from about 2 large ears) (I use frozen corn)  
- 1/2 pound smoked mozzarella cheese, diced fine  
- 1 pint vine-ripened cherry tomatoes, halved  
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh chives  

## Directions

- Stir wheat berries into a kettle of salted, boiling water. Cook at a slow
  boil for 30 minutes.
- Stir in barley and cook grains at a slow boil 40 minutes While grains are
  cooking, in a large bowl stir together onion, garlic paste, vinegar, and oil.
  Drain grains well and add to onion mixture. Toss mixture well and cool.
- Add scallions, corn, mozzarella, tomatoes, and chives. Add salt and pepper to
  taste, and toss well.

Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salad to room
temperature before serving.

----------------------

_Berries_ are whole grains that have been minimally processed--they have been
hulled but still have the bran and germ intact.
