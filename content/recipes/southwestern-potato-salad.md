## Creamy Southwestern Potato Salad

Bon Appétit, July 2005.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

A bold medley of cumin, cayenne, corn, and cilantro ups the flavor here. Great
with grilled fish tacos, steak fajitas, or chipotle-rubbed chicken.

> ½ cup buttermilk
> ¼ cup mayonnaise
> 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
> 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
> ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

> 2 pounds small white-skinned potatoes (such as White Rose)

> 1 cup cooked corn kernels (from 1 medium ear)
> ½ cup chopped sweet onion (such as Vidalia or Maui)
> 1 14-ounce can hearts of palm, drained, each cut crosswise into ⅓-inch-thick rounds
> 2 plum tomatoes, seeded, diced (about 1¼ cups)
> ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
> 1 avocado, pitted, peeled, chopped

Whisk buttermilk, mayonnaise, lime juice, cumin, and cayenne in medium bowl to
blend.

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20
minutes. Drain; cool.

Cut potatoes into ½-inch cubes. Place potatoes in large bowl; add corn, onion,
hearts of palm, tomatoes, and cilantro. Drizzle dressing over potato mixture;
toss to coat. Season generously with salt. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover
and refrigerate.) Gently stir in avocado and serve.

> **Tip:** Pitting an avocado: Cut an unpeeled avocado in half lengthwise.
> Grasp both sides and twist to open. Tap a large knife into the pit so it
> sticks, then twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit.
