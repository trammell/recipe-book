## Margaritas

Makes about 1 quart (serves 4-6).

> 4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium limes
> 4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium lemons
> ¼ cup superfine sugar
> pinch salt
> 2 cups crushed ice
> 1 cup 100 percent agave tequila, preferably reposado
> 1 cup triple sec

Combine the lime zest and juice, the lemon zest and juice, sugar and salt in a
large liquid measuring cup. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
flavors meld, 4 to 24 hours.

Divide 1 cup crushed ice between 4-6 margarita or double old-fashioned
glasses. Strain juice mixture into a 1-quart pitcher or cocktail shaker.  Add
tequila, Triple Sec and remaining ice. Stir or shake until thoroughly combined
and chilled – 20-60 seconds. Strain into ice-filled glasses and serve
immediately.

**Fresh Pineapple Margaritas**

> ½ cored and peeled pineapple (about 1 ¾ pounds)

Puree pineapple in food processor or blender until smooth and foamy. Follow
above recipe except omit zest and steeping process, reduce lemon and lime
juices to ¼ cup each and add ½ cup pineapple juice to juice mixture.

**Fresh Berry Margarita**

Follow recipe above except omit zest and steeping process. Puree 1 cup of
raspberries or strawberries with the lemon and lime juices, sugar and salt in
a food processor or blender. Strain juice mixture into a pitcher or cocktail
shaker. Continue with recipe but reduce Triple Sec to ½ cup and add ½ cup
Chambord to juice and tequila mixture.

*Note:* The longer the zest and the juice mixture are allowed to steep, the
more developed the citrus flavors in the finished margaritas. We recommend
steeping the full 24 hours, although the margaritas wills till be great if the
mixture is steeped for only the minimum of 4 hours. If you are in a rush and
want to serve the margaritas immediately, omit the zest and skip the steeping
process altogether.
