### [Where does the term *scandihoovian* come from?][se]

There's an interesting bit of research on [Stack Exchange][se]:

> people emigrated to North America from Scandinavia and the Nordic countries.
> Many settled in the north and applied their logging expertise from their
> forested homelands.

...

> The fourth volume of the Dictionary of American Regional English fortifies
> Munch's final point with evidence that a jocular Americanized rendition of
> Scandinavian as “Scandihoovian” – alternately Scandahoovian, Scandihuvian,
> Scandinoovian, and Skandihoovian – was circulating as early as 1901,
> particularly in association with Norwegian and Swedish loggers in the Upper
> Midwest and Pacific Northwest.

...

> **SCANDIWEGIAN**: The general maritime slang name for a man or ship from
