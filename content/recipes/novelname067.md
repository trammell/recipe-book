## Susan's Spinach and Cheese Curry

Serves 6.

> 2 tablespoons canola oil  
> 1 medium-size red onion, cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced  
> 6-8 medium-size cloves garlic, coarsely chopped  
> 4 lengthwise slices fresh ginger (each 2 inches long, 1 inch wide,  
>   and ⅛ inch thick), coarsely chopped (a 4 inch piece of ginger)  
> 2 T Garam Masala (see Notes)  
> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric  
> 2 tablespoons tomato paste  
> 8 ounces fresh spinach leaves, well rinsed and coarsely chopped  
> 8 ounces fresh mustard greens, well rinsed and finely chopped (see Notes)  
> ½ pound fried paneer, in 1-inch cubes (see Notes)  
> ½ cup heavy cream or half and half  
> 1 teaspoon Garam Masala (see Notes)  
> salt to taste  

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic,
   and ginger, and stir-fry until the onion is light brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
   Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the garam masala and the
   turmeric. (The heat from the browned onion will be just right to cook the
   spices without burning them.)
2. Transfer the mixture to a blender jar, and add the tomato paste and ¼ cup
   water. Puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, to form a smooth,
   reddish-brown paste. Return the paste to the skillet. Pour ¾ cup water into
   the blender jar, and whir the blades to wash it out. Add this to the
   skillet.
3. Place the skillet over medium heat. Pile handfuls of the greens into the
   skillet, cover it, and let the steam wilt them. Stir, and repeat with the
   remaining greens. Once they are all wilted, cover the skillet and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until the greens are broken down to a sauce-like
   consistency and are olive green in color, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Stir in the paneer, cream, and Punjabi garam masala. Add salt to taste.
   Continue simmering the curry, covered, stirring occasionally, until the
   cheese and cream are warmed through, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve warm over rice.

* The original recipe can be found at <http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/spinach-and-mustard-greens-with-cheese>.
* I just use plain garam masala (and in different quantities than the original
  recipe) but you can get fancy (like the original chef of this recipe) and use
  two garam masalas here in different ways. Initially, you add the untoasted
  blend (the *bin bhuna hua garam marsala*) early on, soon after the onion browns,
  to make sure the raw spices cook, providing the first spice layering. Then you
  swirl in the garam masala (ta toasted Punjabi garam masala) toward the end,
  after the curry has cooked. This blend is a finishing spice yielding a second
  tier of flavors that are aromatic, smooth, and assertive. Both blends contain
  similar spices, but what you did with them at various stages creates a
  complex-tasting sauce.
* The original recipe calls for 1¼ lbs. doodh paneer.  I cut this down
  substantially and often times I either buy it pre-fried or just use it
  without frying it.
* The original recipe calls for 1½ teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt, this
  is too salty for our taste.

**How to Prepare Mustard Greens:**

Fresh mustard greens are available in most supermarkets. To prepare them for
cooking, cut out and discard the tough rib that runs through three-quarters
the length of each leaf. Stack 2 or 3 similar-length leaves and roll them
tightly into a tube shape. Cut the tube into thin crosswise slices and unfold
them to yield ribbons (called a chiffonade). Place them in a large bowl.

Once all the greens are sliced, cover them with cold water. Dunk the leaves
briefly under the water. Grab handfuls of the leaves to lift them out of the
water.  The sand or grit will sink to the bottom. Repeat once or twice to
ensure that the leaves are completely clean and grit-free. 

This recipe is friendly to substitution, consider trying other greens such as
radish, carrot, or arugula.
