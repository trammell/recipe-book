Prep time: about 1 hour. Yields about 3 cups. Serves about 4.

## Ingredients

* ¾ cup moong dal
* 1 bunch amaranth leaves, washed thoroughly, trimmed, chopped finely
* 2 heaping tbsp chopped garlic (about 3 cloves)
* 1 large tomato, finely diced
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* ½ teaspoon turmeric
* 1 tablespoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon amchur (mango) powder

## Instructions

1. Place amaranth leaves in a 2 quart or greater pot. Add enough water to cover
   by about an inch. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook until tender, adding more
   water if needed.
2. Heat the oil. When it shimmers, add the cumin seeds, stir for a few seconds,
   then add the garlic. Saute for 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes. Let the
   tomatoes cook down until they are pulpy.
3. Add the cumin and coriander powders, amchur, and red pepper flakes or
   chilli powder.
4. Stir everything well and let it all cook for a couple of minutes.
5. Add the dal along with the amaranth leaves. Bring to a boil and lower heat
   to a simmer. Add water if the dal is too thick. It really depends on your
   taste-- I like my dal slightly runny.
6. Let the dal simmer for about 5 minutes, then turn off heat and serve hot
   with rice or rotis.

## Notes

What do you do when you get tons of amaranth from your farm share? We found the
original recipe at <https://holycowvegan.net/amaranth-dal/>, but we've made it
enough to suggest some changes.
