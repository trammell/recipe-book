Prep time: about 1 hour. Yields about 3 cups. Serves about 4.

## Ingredients

* ¾ cup moong dal
* 1 bunch amaranth leaves, washed thoroughly, trimmed, chopped finely
* 2 heaping tbsp chopped garlic (about 3 cloves)

* 1 tablespoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon amchur (mango) powder

## Instructions

1. Place amaranth leaves in a 2 quart or greater pot. Add enough water to cover
   by about an inch. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook until tender, adding more
   water if needed.
2. In a separate deep skillet, heat the oil. When it shimmers, add the cumin
   seeds, stir for a few seconds, then add the garlic. Saute for 30 seconds,
   then add the tomatoes. Let the tomatoes cook down until they are pulpy.
3. Add the cumin and coriander powders, amchur, and red pepper flakes or chilli
   powder.
4. Stir everything well and let it all cook for a couple of minutes.

   to a simmer. Let the dal simmer for about 5 minutes, then turn off heat and
   serve hot with rice or rotis.

## Notes

We stumbled across this recipe when we were tring to figure out what to do with
all the amaranth our farm share dropped on us. The original recipe is at
