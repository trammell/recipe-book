## Mexican Chicken Burgers with Lime Cilantro Mayo

**Chicken burgers**

> 1 lb ground pork  
> ½ lb ground chicken  
> 2 t minced garlic  
> 1½ T chile powder  
> ½ c. chopped cilantro  
> 2 t lime zest  
> 1½ t kosher salt  
> ½ t black pepper  
> 1½ c shredded Monterey jack cheese  
> rolls, split & toasted  
> optional: sliced avocado, tomato, red onion, lettuce  

Preheat grill to medium heat. In medium bowl use hands to lightly blend pork,
chicken, garlic, chile powder, cilantro, lime zest, salt, and pepper. Shape
into 6-8 patties.

Grill 3-4 minutes on each side.  Mound cheese on each patty, cover, and cook
until cheese melts.  (Note: the burgers are good without the cheese.)

**Lime cilantro mayonnaise**

> ½ c. mayo (the kind made with olive oil)  
> 1 T lime juice  
> ¼ c. chopped cilantro  

Combine ingredients and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Spread lime mayo on
toasted buns and finish with burger and accompaniments.
