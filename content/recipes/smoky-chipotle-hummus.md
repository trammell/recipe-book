Bon Appétit, October 2001.  Makes 20 servings.

If you don't have time to make your own hummus, buy some at the market or
specialty foods store, and mix in chipotle chilies and cumin to taste.

> 2 15-ounce cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained  
> ½ cup water  
> ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)  
> 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  
> 2 tablespoons olive oil  
> 2½ teaspoons minced canned chipotle chilies  
> 1 large garlic clove, minced  
> 1½ teaspoons ground cumin  
> 1 4-ounce jar sliced pimientos in oil, drained  
> ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro  
> 2 6-ounce packages roasted-garlic bagel chips  

Reserve 3 tablespoons garbanzo beans for garnish. Blend remaining garbanzo
beans and next 7 ingredients in processor until smooth. Add pimientos;
process, using on/off turns, until pimientos are coarsely chopped. Transfer
hummus to medium bowl. Stir in cilantro. Season hummus to taste with salt and
pepper. Sprinkle with reserved garbanzo beans. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover
and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.) Accompany with bagel
chips.
