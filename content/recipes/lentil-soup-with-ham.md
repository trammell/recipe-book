## Lentil Soup with Smoked Ham

Bon Appétit, October 1999.  Makes 2 servings.

Start with hearts of romaine topped with balsamic dressing and diced feta
cheese, and pass whole grain bread. Have chocolate cupcakes afterward.

> 1½ tablespoons olive oil  
> 1½ cups diced smoked ham  
> 2 teaspoons dried savory  
> 1½ teaspoons dry mustard  
> 3 cups (or more) canned low-salt chicken broth  
> 1 cup brown lentils, rinsed  
> 1 14½-ounce can diced tomatoes with roasted garlic  

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ham, savory and
mustard and stir until ham begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add 3 cups broth
and lentils and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until
lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices; simmer
uncovered 2 minutes. Add more broth by ¼ cupfuls to thin soup, if desired.
Season with salt and pepper.
