  "Berries" are whole grains that have been minimally processed--they
  have been hulled but still have the bran and germ intact.

# Gourmet, July 1994. Serves 6 as a main course or 8 to 10 as a side dish.

ingredients:
- 1 cup wheat berries  
- 1 cup pearl barley  
- 1 small red onion, chopped fine  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced and mashed to a paste with ½ teaspoon salt  
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar  
- ¼ cup olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)  
- 6 scallions, chopped fine  
- 1 ½ cups cooked corn (cut from about 2 large ears) (I use frozen corn)  
- ½ pound smoked mozzarella cheese, diced fine  
- 1 pint vine-ripened cherry tomatoes, halved  
- ½ cup chopped fresh chives  

directions:
  - >
    Stir wheat berries into a kettle of salted, boiling water. Cook at
    a slow boil for 30 minutes.
  - >
    Stir in barley and cook grains at a slow boil 40 minutes
    While grains are cooking, in a large bowl stir together onion, garlic paste,
    vinegar, and oil.  Drain grains well and add to onion mixture. Toss mixture
    well and cool.
  - >
   Add scallions, corn, mozzarella, tomatoes, and chives.
   Add salt and pepper to taste, and toss well.

# Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salad to room
# temperature before serving.
