## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant (1½ pounds)
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium zucchini, trimmed and cut lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick slices
- 2 red bell peppers, quartered lengthwise
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1¾ teaspoons salt
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3½ cups whole milk
- 3 ounces Italian Fontina, coarsely grated (1 cup)
- 1 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (½ cup)
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil
- 5 (6¾" x 3½") or 10 (7" x 6¾") no-boil lasagne noodles

## Directions

- Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 425°F.

- Cut 3 (⅓-inch-thick) lengthwise slices from center of eggplant and reserve
  remainder for another use. Brush 2 large shallow baking pans with 1
  tablespoon oil total, then arrange eggplant, zucchini, and bell peppers in 1
  layer in pans. Brush vegetables with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle
  with pepper and 1¼ teaspoons salt. Roast, switching position of pans halfway
  through roasting, until eggplant and zucchini are browned and tender, 15 to
  20 minutes total, then transfer eggplant and zucchini to a plate. Turn
  peppers over and continue to roast until tender, about 10 minutes more.
  Transfer peppers to a bowl and cover, then let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
  move 1 rack to middle position and leave oven on. Peel peppers.

- While vegetables roast, cook garlic in butter in a 1½- to 2-quart heavy
  saucepan over moderate heat, whisking frequently, until fragrant, about 30
  seconds. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Add milk in
  a slow stream, whisking, and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce
  heat and simmer, whisking frequently, 8 minutes (sauce will thicken slightly
  when it first comes to a boil). Remove from heat and cool béchamel sauce,
  stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Stir in cheeses, basil, and remaining ½
  teaspoon salt.

- Soak noodles in hot water just until pliable, 8 to 10 minutes.

- Spread ⅔ cup sauce in an 8-inch square baking dish. Drain 1 large noodle or
  2 small noodles on a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and put over sauce
  in dish. Top with half of zucchini in 1 layer, ½ cup sauce, and another
  noodle (or 2). Make another layer with all of eggplant, ½ cup sauce, and
  another noodle (or 2), and another with all of bell peppers, ½ cup sauce,
  and another noodle (or 2). Top with remaining zucchini, ½ cup sauce, and
  another noodle (or 2). Cover completely with remaining sauce.

- Bake until golden and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand in pan on a rack
  20 minutes.
