## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant (1 1/2 pounds)
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium zucchini, trimmed and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices
- 2 red bell peppers, quartered lengthwise
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 cups whole milk
- 3 ounces Italian Fontina, coarsely grated (1 cup)
- 1 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (1/2 cup)
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil
- 5 (6 3/4- by 3 1/2-inch) or 10 (7- by 6 3/4-inch) no-boil lasagne noodles

## Directions

- Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 425°F.

- Cut 3 (1/3-inch-thick) lengthwise slices from center of eggplant and reserve
  remainder for another use. Brush 2 large shallow baking pans with 1 tablespoon
  oil total, then arrange eggplant, zucchini, and bell peppers in 1 layer in
  pans. Brush vegetables with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with
  pepper and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Roast, switching position of pans halfway
  through roasting, until eggplant and zucchini are browned and tender, 15 to 20
  minutes total, then transfer eggplant and zucchini to a plate. Turn peppers
  over and continue to roast until tender, about 10 minutes more. Transfer
  peppers to a bowl and cover, then let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, move 1 rack
  to middle position and leave oven on. Peel peppers.

- While vegetables roast, cook garlic in butter in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy
  saucepan over moderate heat, whisking frequently, until fragrant, about 30
  seconds. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Add milk in
  a slow stream, whisking, and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat
  and simmer, whisking frequently, 8 minutes (sauce will thicken slightly when
  it first comes to a boil). Remove from heat and cool béchamel sauce, stirring
  occasionally, 10 minutes. Stir in cheeses, basil, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon
  salt.
  
- Soak noodles in hot water just until pliable, 8 to 10 minutes.

- Spread 2/3 cup sauce in an 8-inch square baking dish. Drain 1 large noodle or
  2 small noodles on a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and put over sauce
  in dish. Top with half of zucchini in 1 layer, 1/2 cup sauce, and another
  noodle (or 2). Make another layer with all of eggplant, 1/2 cup sauce, and
  another noodle (or 2), and another with all of bell peppers, 1/2 cup sauce,
  and another noodle (or 2). Top with remaining zucchini, 1/2 cup sauce, and
  another noodle (or 2). Cover completely with remaining sauce.
  
- Bake until golden and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand in pan on a rack
  20 minutes.
