Bon Appétit, March 1997. Makes 27 cookies (we make them smaller). Susan's favorite.

* 1½ cups unbleached all purpose flour  
* ⅓ cup old-fashioned oats  
* 1 teaspoon baking soda  
* ¼ teaspoon salt  
* 1 cup old-fashioned chunky peanut butter (about 9 ounces)  
* 1 cup (packed) golden brown sugar  
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature  
* ¼ cup honey  
* 1 large egg  
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
* 5 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped  

## Instructions

Mix flour, oats, baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer,
beat peanut butter, brown sugar, butter, honey, egg and vanilla in large bowl
until well blended. Stir dry ingredients into peanut butter mixture in 2
additions. Stir in chopped chocolate. Cover and refrigerate until dough is firm
and no longer sticky, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 °F. Butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. With hands, roll 1
heaping tablespoonful of dough for each cookie into 1 ¾-inch-diameter ball.
Arrange cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 ½ inches apart. Bake
cookies until puffed, beginning to brown on top and still very soft to touch,
about 12 minutes.

Cool cookies on baking sheets 5 minutes. Using metal spatula, transfer cookies
to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight
container at room temperature.)
