> 2 small heads cauliflower

1. Remove heavy leaves and tough stems from cauliflower; cut into 4 to 6 wedges
   each. Place cauliflower in a microwave-safe 3-quart casserole. Add ½ cup
   water.  Microcook, covered, on 100 percent power (high) for 7 to 9 minutes
   or just until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon to serving plates. Top
   with ham and cheese.
2. In a screw top jar combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, sugar, mustard,
   and pepper. Cover and shake well to combine; drizzle over cauliflower, ham,
   and cheese. Sprinkle with pine nuts and capers. Makes 4 servings.

*Note*: Serrano ham comes from Spain; find it in some specialty markets or at
www.tienda.com.  Substitute another thinly sliced ham if needed.
