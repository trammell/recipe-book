Summary: A rich, luscious hot fudge recipe.

*Gourmet*, February 2004. Makes about 2 cups. This recipe takes about 30 minutes
from start to finish.

## Ingredients

- 2/3 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup light corn syrup  
- 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar  
- 1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder  
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 6 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped  
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla  

## Directions

1. Bring cream, corn syrup, sugar, cocoa, salt, and half of chocolate to a boil
   in a 1 to 1 Â½-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until
   chocolate is melted.
2. Reduce heat and cook at a low boil, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes, then
   remove from heat.
3. Add butter, vanilla, and remaining chocolate and stir until smooth.
4. Cool sauce to warm before serving.

## Comments

* Sauce can be made ahead and cooled completely, then chilled in an airtight
  container or jar. Reheat before using.
* Sauce can be eaten directly from the jar with a spoon, or with your fingers
  in a pinch.
* I have used Baker's chocolate squares and I never chop them.
* This recipe doubles or triples nicely.
