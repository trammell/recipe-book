## Susan's Guacamole

Serves 6 (unless Uncle John is visiting then serves not so many)

> 2 medium avocados  
> 1 small tomato, chopped  
> 2 tablespoons minced onion  
> 1-2 teaspoons lime or lemon juice  
> ½ teaspoon garlic powder  
> ½ teaspoon salt  

Peel avocadoes. Mash with a fork in a medium bowl.  Stir in tomato, onion,
lime or lemon juice, garlic powder and salt.  Serve quickly with chips or jicama slices.

* Susan likes using the lemon juice versus the lime.
* The avocado will rapidly darken when exposed to air; to delay this press
  plastic wrap down on to the guacamole to keep air away.
