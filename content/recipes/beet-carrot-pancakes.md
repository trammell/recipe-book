Bon Appétit, March 1998. Makes 8 servings.

An interesting side dish or meatless entrée.

> 1⅓ cups (packed) coarsely shredded peeled beets (from 2 medium)
> 1 cup coarsely shredded peeled carrots (from 2 medium)
> 1 cup thinly sliced onion
> 1 large egg
> ½ teaspoon salt
> ¼ teaspoon pepper
> ¼ cup all purpose flour

> 3 tablespoons olive oil
> Low-fat sour cream

Preheat oven to 300 °F. Place baking sheet in oven. Combine beets, carrots and
onion in large bowl. Mix in egg, salt and pepper. Add flour; stir to blend
well.

Heat 1½ tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Using ⅓ cup
beet mixture for each pancake, drop 4 pancakes into skillet. Flatten each into
3-inch round. Cook until brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer pancakes to baking sheet in oven; keep warm. Repeat with remaining
beet mixture, making 4 more pancakes.

Serve pancakes with sour cream.
