The key to fluffy millet is to toast it well before adding a liquid.
Rinsing after toasting helps to remove bitter compounds from the grains' exterior.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup dry, uncooked millet. 
* 2 1/4 cups water
* 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste. 
* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 1/2 cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2/3 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
* 1/3 cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
* 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Place the dry millet in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Dry-toast the millet, stirring constantly,
   10-15 minutes, or until darker and aromatic. Transfer to a fine wire-mesh strainer and rinse under cool
   running water until runoff is clear. Return to saucepan and carefully add water, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt,
   and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until
   all water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let rest 5-10 minutes.
2. Dry-toast pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat until golden, stirring constantly, 3â€“5 minutes.
   Transfer to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice,
   vinegar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
3. Fluff cooked millet and add to pine nuts. Add dressing, tomatoes, olives, and parsley; toss until combined.
   Season with salt and pepper.
