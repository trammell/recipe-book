## Grilled Chicken Moroccan Style

Bon Appétit, June 2003. Makes 6 servings.

Start marinating the chicken four to six hours ahead. Pour frosty Pilsners or a
chilled Chenin Blanc.

> 1 cup olive oil
> ¼ cup red wine vinegar
> 3 tablespoons ground cumin
> 1 ½ tablespoons ground coriander
> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
> 2 teaspoons salt
> 2 teaspoons sugar
> ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
> 4 large chicken breast halves with skin and ribs, cut crosswise in half
> 4 chicken legs
> 4 chicken thighs

> ¼ cup minced fresh parsley

Whisk first 8 ingredients in large glass baking dish. Add all chicken; turn to
coat.  Cover with plastic wrap; chill 4 to 6 hours.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Place marinade-coated chicken on barbecue.
Grill chicken until just cooked through, occasionally brushing with any
remaining marinade, about 10 minutes per side for breasts and about 12 minutes
per side for leg and thigh pieces. Transfer chicken to platter. Sprinkle with
parsley.  Drink pilsner.
