## Is rhubarb poisonous?

Sort of. From [Wikipedia][wkpd]:

> Rhubarb leaves contain poisonous substances, including oxalic acid, a
> nephrotoxin. The long term consumption of oxalic acid leads to kidney stone
> formation in humans. Humans have been poisoned after ingesting the leaves, a
> particular problem during World War I when the leaves were mistakenly
> recommended as a food source in Britain. The toxic rhubarb leaves have been
> used in flavouring extracts, after the oxalic acid is removed by treatment
> with precipitated chalk (i.e., calcium carbonate).
>
> The LD50 (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg
> body weight, or about 25 grams for a 65-kilogram (143 lb) human. Other
> sources give a much higher oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600
> mg/kg. While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical
> value is about 0.5%, meaning a 65 kg adult would need to eat 4 to 8 kg (9 to
> 18 lbs) to obtain a lethal dose, depending on which lethal dose is assumed.
> Cooking the leaves with baking soda can make them more poisonous by producing
> soluble oxalates. The leaves are believed to also contain an additional,
> unidentified toxin, which might be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as
> senna glycosides).

The takeaway? Eat rhubarb stalks, not the leaves.
