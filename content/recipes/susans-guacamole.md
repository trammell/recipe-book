Classic 6-ingredient guacamole. Prep time: 10 minutes. Serves: 4.

## Ingredients

- 2 medium avocados
- 1 small tomato, chopped
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- 1-2 teaspoons lemon or lime juice
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Directions

- Peel avocadoes. Mash with a fork in a medium bowl.
- Stir in tomato, onion, lime or lemon juice, garlic powder and salt.
- Serve quickly with chips or jicama slices.

## Tips

* Lime juice will do in a pinch, but we prefer this recipe with lemon juice.
* The avocado will rapidly darken when exposed to air. To delay this, press
  plastic wrap down on to the guacamole to keep air away.
