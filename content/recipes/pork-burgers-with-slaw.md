## Barbecued Pork Burgers with Slaw

Gourmet, August 2007, by Alexis Touchet.  Makes 4 -5 burgers.

Spicing up store-bought barbecue sauce with a touch of cayenne and a splash of
vinegar is an easy trick that makes a big difference. Here, pork burgers get a
triple hit of flavor: The sauce gets mixed into the meat, slathered onto the
cooked burgers for the last minute of grilling, and brushed on the bun. A
cabbage slaw with a creamy dressing tops them off with just the right crunch.

> 1 (½-pound) piece green cabbage, cored
> ¼ cup mayonnaise
> 1 tablespoon milk
> 1 tablespoon plus 1½ teaspoons white-wine vinegar, divided
> ½ cup very finely shredded carrot (1 medium)
> 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh chives
> ½ cup bottled tomato-based barbecue sauce
> ¼ teaspoon cayenne
> 1½ pounds ground pork
> 4 Kaiser or soft rolls, split and grilled

Equipment: an adjustable-blade slicer

Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium heat for gas).

Thinly slice enough cabbage with slicer to measure 2 cups. Whisk together
mayonnaise, milk, and 1 ½ teaspoons vinegar until smooth, then toss with
cabbage, carrots, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Let coleslaw stand at
room temperature, uncovered, while making burgers.

Stir together barbecue sauce, cayenne, ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining
tablespoon vinegar until combined well.

Mix together pork, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and 2 tablespoons
barbecue sauce mixture until combined (do not overmix), then form into 4
(¾-inch-thick) burgers (4 inches in diameter).

Oil grill rack, then grill patties, covered only if using a gas grill, turning
over occasionally, until just cooked through, about 6 minutes total. Brush top
of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce mixture, then turn over and
grill 30 seconds. Brush top of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce,
then turn over and grill 30 seconds more.

Brush cut sides of rolls with remaining ¼ cup barbecue sauce, then sandwich
patties and coleslaw between rolls.

Coleslaw can be made 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Patties can be formed
1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.
