## Chicken Burgers

Makes 5 generous servings.

* ¾ c. panko bread crumbs  
* ⅓ c. buttermilk  
* ⅓ tsp. black pepper  
* ⅓ tsp cayenne pepper  
* ¼ tsp. salt  
* 20 oz chicken, ground  

Mix all ingredients together. Form into patties. Grill on a griddle
sprayed lightly with oil.

* Goes well with coleslaw (see next recipe).
* These do not grill well on an outdoor grill, as they are quite moist.
* Other varieties (e.g. chipotle) of pepper work also.  Use more pepper
  for a spicier burger!


## Cole Slaw

This slaw goes well with the above chicken burger recipe. Eat as a side or
right on top of the burger!

Dressing ingredients:

* ½ c. plain yogurt  
* ¼ c. mayonnaise  
* 5 T. apple cider vinegar  
* ¾ tsp celery seed  
* 4 tsp. sugar  

Slaw ingredients:

* ½ head red cabbage, shredded  
* 3 shredded carrots
* 1½ shredded beauty heart radishes (optional, but gorgeous)

Mix dressing ingredients. Add cabbage, radish and carrot.

From https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/coleslaw-vs-cold-slaw:

> Coleslaw is the common name and spelling for the side salad listed on
> restaurant menus (especially those having barbecue, seafood, or fried
> food options) that typically consists of raw shredded cabbage with a
> mayonnaise- or vinegar-based dressing. The name is from Dutch koolsla,
> a combining of kool (meaning "cabbage") with sla ("salad") that results
> in a word that means "cabbage salad."
