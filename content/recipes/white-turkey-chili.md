## White Turkey Chili

Made with chunks of cooked turkey, this hearty chili is a wonderful way to use
up leftovers from the Thanksgiving feast.  Serves 6 to 8.

> 2 Tbs. olive oil
> 1 large yellow onion, diced
> salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
> 2 tsp. toasted ground cumin
> 5 garlic cloves, minced
> 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
> 1 lb. Anaheim chilies, roasted, peeled and diced, or 3 cans (each 7 oz.) whole fire-roasted Anaheim chilies, diced
> 4 to 4½ cups low-sodium chicken broth, warmed
> 1 lb. diced cooked turkey
> 3 cans (each 15 oz.) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed, or 4½ cups cooked white beans, drained
> 2 Tbs. minced fresh oregano
> ⅓ cup minced fresh cilantro
> ¼ cup cornmeal
> Shredded jack cheese, sour cream and lime wedges for serving

In a large sauté pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion,
season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5
to 7 minutes. Add the cumin, garlic and jalapeño and cook, stirring, for 30
seconds. Stir in the chilies and 3½ cups of the broth, and then transfer to a
slow cooker. Stir in the turkey, beans, oregano and cilantro.

Put the cornmeal in a small bowl and slowly whisk in ½ cup of the broth. Stir
the cornmeal mixture into the turkey mixture. Cover and cook on high for 3
hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thin the chili with more
broth if needed.

Ladle the chili into warmed bowls. Serve with cheese, sour cream and lime wedges.
