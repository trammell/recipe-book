Makes about 2 cups of pesto.

## Ingredients

* 4 cups basil leaves, washed and dried
* a pinch of salt
* ¼ cup virgin olive oil (see below)
* ¼ cup pine nuts
* ¼ cup grated parmesan
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and pressed

Gently pack basil into a food processor. Add a pinch of salt to keep the basil
from turning black.  Add olive oil, pine nuts, parmesan, and garlic. Cream in
food processor until stiff.

## Notes

* You may need to add more ingredients (usually olive oil or parmesan) to get
  the desired texture and flavor. Experiment!
* You may prefer the taste of roasted pine nuts. You do you!
* Pesto stores well in the freezer. Freeze in an airtight container with a thin
  layer of olive oil on top of the pesto to prevent freezer burn.
