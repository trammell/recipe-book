Margaritas
Makes about 1 Quart, serves 4-6

4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium limes
4 teaspoons grated zest plus ½ cup juice from 2-3 medium lemons
¼ cup superfine sugar
Pinch salt
2 cups crushed ice
1 cup 100 percent agave tequila, preferably reposado
1 cup Triple Sec

1. Combine the lime zest and juice, the lemon zest and juice, sugar and salt in a large liquid measuring cup.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors meld, 4 to 24 hours.
2. Divide 1 cup crushed ice between 4-6 margarita or double old-fashioned glasses. Strain juice mixture into a 1-quart pitcher or cocktail shaker.  Add tequila, Triple Sec and remaining ice. Stir or shake until thoroughly combined and chilled – 20-60 seconds. Strain into ice-filled glasses and serve immediately.

Variations:
Fresh Pineapple Margaritas  
1/2 cored and peeled pineapple (about 1 3/4 pounds)
Puree pineapple in food processor or blender until smooth and foamy.  Follow above recipe except omit zest and steeping process, reduce lemon and lime juices to ¼ cup each and add ½ cup pineapple juice to juice mixture.

Fresh Raspberry or Strawberry Margarita
Follow recipe above except omit zest and steeping process.  Puree 1 cup of raspberries or strawberries with the lemon and lime juices, sugar and salt in a food processor or blender.  Strain juice mixture into a pitcher or cocktail shaker. Continue with recipe but reduce Triple Sec to ½ cup and add ½ cup Chambord to juice and tequila mixture.

Note:  The longer the zest and the juice mixture are allowed to steep, the more developed the citrus flavors in the finished margaritas.  We recommend steeping the full 24 hours, although the margaritas wills till be great if the mixture is steeped for only the minimum of 4 hours.  If you are in a rush and want to serve the margaritas immediately, omit the zest and skip the steeping process altogether.

Susan’s Spinach and Cheese Curry

Yield: Serves 6

Ingredients

2 tablespoons canola oil
1 medium-size red onion, cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced
6-8 medium-size cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
4 lengthwise slices fresh ginger (each 2 inches long, 1 inch wide, and 1/8 inch thick), coarsely chopped (a 4 inch piece of ginger)
2 T Garam Masala (see Notes)
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 tablespoons tomato paste
8 ounces fresh spinach leaves, well rinsed and coarsely chopped
8 ounces fresh mustard greens, well rinsed and finely chopped (see Notes)
1½ teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt
½  pound Doodh Paneer, cut into 1-inch cubes and pan-fried  (see Notes)
½ cup heavy cream or half and half
1 teaspoon Garam Masala (see Notes)

Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and stir-fry until the onion is light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the garam masala and the turmeric. (The heat from the browned onion will be just right to cook the spices without burning them.)
2. Transfer the mixture to a blender jar, and add the tomato paste and ¼ cup water. Puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, to form a smooth, reddish-brown paste. Return the paste to the skillet. Pour ¾ cup water into the blender jar, and whir the blades to wash it out. Add this to the skillet.
3. Place the skillet over medium heat. Pile handfuls of the greens into the skillet, cover it, and let the steam wilt them. Stir, and repeat with the remaining greens. Once they are all wilted, cover the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens are broken down to a sauce-like consistency and are olive green in color, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Stir in the salt, paneer cubes, cream, and Punjabi garam masala. Continue simmering the curry, covered, stirring occasionally, until the cheese and cream are warmed through, 5 to 8 minutes. Then serve.

Notes

The original recipe can be found at http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/spinach-and-mustard-greens-with-cheese 
I just use plain garam masala (and in different quantities than the original recipe) but you can get fancy (like the original chef of this recipe) and use two garam masalas here in different ways. Initially, you add the untoasted blend (the Bin bhuna hua garam marsala) early on, soon after the onion browns, to make sure the raw spices cook, providing the first spice layering. Then you swirl in the garam masala (ta toasted Punjabi garam masala) toward the end, after the curry has cooked. This blend is a finishing spice yielding a second tier of flavors that are aromatic, smooth, and assertive. Both blends contain similar spices, but what you did with them at various stages creates a complex-tasting sauce.  
The original recipe calls for 1 ¼ lb Doodh paneer.  I cut this down substantially and often times I either buy it pre-fried or just use it without frying it.
How to Prepare Mustard Greens:
Fresh mustard greens are available in most supermarkets. To prepare them for cooking, cut out and discard the tough rib that runs through three-quarters the length of each leaf. Stack 2 or 3 similar-length leaves and roll them tightly into a tube shape. Cut the tube into thin crosswise slices and unfold them to yield ribbons (called a chiffonade). Place them in a large bowl. Once all the greens are sliced, cover them with cold water. Dunk the leaves briefly under the water. Grab handfuls of the leaves to lift them out of the water. The sand or grit will sink to the bottom. Repeat once or twice to ensure that the leaves are completely clean and grit-free.

Hot and Sour Soup

To rehydrate dried whole mushrooms, place them in a bowl, add boiling water to cover and let soak for 30 minutes, until soft. For dried mushroom slices, reduce the soaking time to 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well. For extra mushroom flavor, reserve the soaking liquid and add it to the dish. Before using, strain the liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter to remove any grit. 

Accompany the soup with a shredded cabbage salad dressed with rice wine vinegar, sugar and a little oil.

Ingredients:
1 oz. dried Chinese black mushrooms or dried shiitake mushrooms
3 cups boiling water
2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. white wine vinegar
1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. soy sauce
1/2 tsp. Asian sesame oil
1 1/4 tsp. Asian chili oil
1/2 tsp. freshly ground pepper, plus more, to taste
5 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup canned thinly sliced bamboo shoots, rinsed and drained
1 boneless, skinless whole chicken breast, about 1/2 lb., cut crosswise into thin bite-size  slices
1/4 lb. firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2- inch cubes
2 Tbs. cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 egg, well beaten

Directions:
Soak the dried mushrooms in the boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain the mushrooms and slice them thinly. Set aside. 

In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil and the 1/2 tsp. pepper. Set aside. 

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Add the mushrooms and bamboo shoots and cook until the stock is aromatic, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken and tofu. Cook until the chicken is just opaque throughout and the tofu is heated through, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved vinegar-soy mixture and bring to a simmer. 

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add to the soup and stir until the soup begins to thicken. Remove from the heat. Add the egg, whisking with a fork until little shreds of cooked egg form. Taste and adjust the seasonings with vinegar, pepper or soy sauce. 

Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and serve immediately.

Orange-Rosemary Chicken 
Bon Appétit | July 1997

It's almost as quick to make the citrus-herb glaze that coats the chicken as it is to open a bottle of barbecue sauce-and the glaze has a far more interesting taste. Pour a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc for the grown-ups; the kids should have lemonade. Finish up with watermelon and brownies.

Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
Yield: Makes 6 Servings
Active Time: 45 minutes or less
Total Time: 45 minutes or less

1 12-ounce container frozen orange juice from concentrate, thawed
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup honey-Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried
4 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)
1 large garlic clove, chopped

1 cup hickory smoke chips, soaked in water 30 minutes, drained
2 7-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces (breasts halved if large)

Blend first 7 ingredients in processor. Set orange glaze aside.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Place smoke chips in 8x6-inch foil packet with open top. Set packet atop coals about 5 minutes before grilling. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Grill chicken until golden, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes per side. Continue grilling chicken until cooked through, brushing glaze over chicken and turning occasionally, about 25 minutes longer. Transfer to platter.

Barbecued Pork Burgers with Slaw 
Gourmet | August 2007
Alexis Touchet
Spicing up store-bought barbecue sauce with a touch of cayenne and a splash of vinegar is an easy trick that makes a big difference. Here, pork burgers get a triple hit of flavor: The sauce gets mixed into the meat, slathered onto the cooked burgers for the last minute of grilling, and brushed on the bun. A cabbage slaw with a creamy dressing tops them off with just the right crunch.
Yield: Makes 4 -5 burgers

1 (1/2-pound) piece green cabbage, cored
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons white-wine vinegar, divided
1/2 cup very finely shredded carrot (1 medium)
1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh chives
1/2 cup bottled tomato-based barbecue sauce
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
4 Kaiser or soft rolls, split and grilled

Equipment: an adjustable-blade slicer

Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium heat for gas).
Thinly slice enough cabbage with slicer to measure 2 cups. Whisk together mayonnaise, milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar until smooth, then toss with cabbage, carrots, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Let coleslaw stand at room temperature, uncovered, while making burgers.
Stir together barbecue sauce, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining tablespoon vinegar until combined well.
Mix together pork, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce mixture until combined (do not overmix), then form into 4 (3/4-inch-thick) burgers (4 inches in diameter).
Oil grill rack, then grill patties, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, until just cooked through, about 6 minutes total. Brush top of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce mixture, then turn over and grill 30 seconds. Brush top of each patty with 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce, then turn over and grill 30 seconds more.
Brush cut sides of rolls with remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce, then sandwich patties and coleslaw between rolls.

Coleslaw can be made 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered. •Patties can be formed 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered. •

Louisiana Red Beans and Rice

(Tyler Florence recipe from the foodnetwork.com)
Serves: 6 servings

Ingredients
•  1 pound dried small red beans, picked over and rinsed
•  2 large smoked ham hocks
•  1 large yellow onion, chopped
•  2 celery stalks, chopped
•  1 large green bell pepper, chopped
•  1 teaspoon cayenne
•  1/4 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
•  2 sprigs fresh thyme
•  3 bay leaves
•  4 garlic cloves, chopped
•  2 green onions, green part only, chopped, plus more for garnish
•  Red pepper sauce
•  2 andouille sausages, sliced thin
•  4 cups cooked white rice

Directions
Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator.
Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot with the ham hocks, adding just enough cold water to cover (about 2 quarts). Add the onion, celery, green pepper, cayenne, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, green onions, and several shakes of red pepper sauce; give everything a good stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 21/2 hours. You want the beans to be almost overcooked, like they are getting ready to burst. Stir the beans occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot. Add about 1 cup of water toward the end of cooking if the mixture appears too thick or dry.
Mash about 1 cup of the cooked beans against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon, this makes the broth thick and creamy. Toss in the sausages and cook for another 30 minutes to heat them through. Adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve the red beans in a wide bowl over some steamed white rice and garnished with chopped green onion.
